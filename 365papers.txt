I did 365papers a few years ago. Lots of work but ultimately quite rewarding reading and writing about 365 papers over a year. So, I'll try again this year starting with this very recent paper. 
1/ #365papers 
In which a new module for the PUCM urban canopy model is developed, PUCM-mist, to model the impacts of misters. Modelling is performed for Phoenix and Houston (dry and humid climates), finding a flow rate of 0.1L/min can induce reductions in maximum canyon air temperature of 17.5C. Cooling is also seen in Houston, but about half that amount. Optimal cooling under intermediate wind speeds. Rapid cooling can be induced through the combination of misting and pavement sprinkling. Trying to wrap my head around the 17.5C, which is huge, but using lots of water and saturating the air, and altering both the potential maximum temperature and the time of day the maximum is reached.

Urban heat mitigation through misting, and its role in broader blue infrastructure portfolios

In which the author (who is the founder of Sci-Hub) discusses different types of open access for scientific publications (and color codes), ranging from Sci-Hub (red), open access - PloS, MDPI, Frontiers (yellow/gold), preprints - arXiv (green), academic social networks - ResearchGate (blue). New categories beyond the green and gold ones established after the Budapest Open Access Initiative.

In which proposed policies (mass deportations, tariffs, reduced independence of the Federal Reserve) of a second Trump presidency are evaluated for their potential impacts on the US and global economy. Combined scenarios of high impact (60% tariffs with trading partner retaliations, 8 million deportations, no Reserve independence) could cause a 10% reduction in GDP and 7% inflation while lower impact (60% tariffs without retaliations, 1 million deportations, Reserve independence erosion) will still account for 3% reduction in GDP and 4% inflation.

In which the impacts of tree planting projects for biomass storage at high northern latitudes are examined. The disturbances caused by albedo changes and the disruption of soil carbon storage will cause net warming and negative effects on Arctic biota and livelihoods. Tree planting can be great but the Arctic probably isn't the right place for it.

In which, using wet-bulb temperature (accounting for humid heat) data across Mexico, high heat kills disproportionately more young people (especially under 5) than elderly (who more more vulnerable to cold). Children have higher body surface area, less developed immune systems, and less independence to express their discomfort. And young adults have higher exposure to high heat situations and less resources to adapt. Further, climate change is expected to drive increased disproportionate impacts.

5/ #365papers 

In which many questions and assumptions about urban scaling theory are addressed. Urban scaling started as identifying nonlinear relationships of urban growth relative to population. Contrasts are made between scaling and Zipf's and Gravity laws. How different definitions of cities effect them. Do they apply to past settlements? Interactions between cities. And the place of urban scaling in general urban science.

In which the author examines (in 1955) how earthworms react to different water conditions (dry vs full immersion). Sort of trying to find why worms are found on pavement after rain. They show some resistance to desiccation.  
Some worms are found to be able to survive underwater for days or even weeks. Given a choice, some species seek air-filled soil while some go for water-filled soil.

7/ #365papers 

In which, in more recent earthworm research, some species show poor tolerance to water immersion and generally use more oxygen at night. Other species can survive longer underwater and have lower oxygen consumption and without a diurnal rhythm. So, why worms emerge from rain soaked soil at night might depend on which species and different oxygen needs.

In which the rates of divorce (termination of a pair bond) of the Seychelles warbler are examined as influenced by weather. Findings are that increased divorces are preceded by years of low and high rainfall. It remains unclear whether this is adaptive, maladaptive, or neutral. Or can these behaviour changes help adapt to a changing climate?

In which the increase in emissions to add AI generated answers (GPT-3) to Google search results is quantified. In 2009, Google search used about 0.0003 kWh per search (0.2g of CO2). Increased efficiency probably means current searches use 0.000004 kWh. Adding AI probably brings this up to 0.002 kWh, or about 100 times more. Additionally, while training AI is resource intensive, the subsequent usage of ChatGPT dominates emissions.

10/ #365papers 

In which the openness of OpenAI (and AI in general) is examined. Findings are that most modern AI is dependent on and controlled by a few large corporations. Openness mostly fails in the categories of transparency, reusability, and extensibility. Underlying hidden problem of colonialism - labor exploitation and cultural data sovereignty. Necessary computational resources close general access. AI might have a similar story to corporate dominance moves in open-source software, but some differences exist.

In which the potential for the Kessler Syndrome (runaway debris growth in Earth's orbit rendering the space too dangerous/destructive for satellites and space travel) is examined and a framework for regulating/minimizing that. Mega-constellations (i.e. Starlink) have massively increased the risk. Will mandating shortening de-orbit rules be offset by the increased launches? Can spacecraft be strengthened to resist debris, and in turn create less debris?

In which Kessler revisits the Kessler Syndrome and finding that (in 1991), many regions of low Earth orbit were already unstable due to space debris from old rockets and payloads and fragments from explosions. Future collisions have the potential to generate new fragments from collisions faster than atmosphereic drag could remove them. Being able to reverse this situation is unlikely.

In which healthcare, in crisis particularly in the US and UK, could continue to degrade. With one path towards ever increasing efficiency, data collection, and technical mechanisation of healthcare, with increased involvement of retail and data corporations and lots of pharmaceuticals. Or the path (obviously favoured by the authors) to recognise the crisis as a crisis in care, requiring human responses and interactions. Going past what makes life possible to what makes living meaningful.

In which the information processing speed of the brain and how that impacts human behaviour is examined. Our senses work at a rate of 10^9 bits per second while the overall information throughput is 10 bits per second (limited by time required to commit to short term memory). No real evidence for photographic memories. Brain storage conventionally estimated at 50TB but probably more like 5GB. 10b/sec limit probably evolutionally sufficient for survival. Brain implants (Neuralink) also probably limited to 10b/sec. Eye implants for blind probably better achieved thorough natural language speech narration than video connection to brain. Processing probably limited to serial not parallel. Suggestion that there is an outer brain (dealing with sensory input and motor output) and inner brain with reduced data flow to make decisions and control behaviour.

In which questions are asked about where are sports stadiums being sited in the last 2 decades and do communities benefit? 2/3 of the costs through public finance, almost always in a CBD. Generally low community contestation. Only 5 of 89 stadiums built under a community-governed community benefit agreement (generally lower capacity stadiums). Subsidies appear to continue while little benefit flows back to the community.

In which parking lots are found to have a large negative impact on walkability. Objective scores are 3.5x less than pedestrian/bike path segments. Subjective assessments are not attractive and feel unsafe to walk in. Must walk through a parking lot to reach most buildings. Adding some pedestrian features (enclosure, tree cover, traffic control devices) can make parking lots slightly less bad.

In which gender and weather are considered in their impacts on active travel in Sydney. Male cyclists outnumber female 3-1 (greater imbalance than with walking). More cyclists and pedestrians on sunny days (especially sensitive with cyclists). Most active at afternoon peak hours. However, none of these factors shifted the gender ratios.

In which appropriative signification (co-opting language of protest) is being used as a tactic to maintain fossil fuel dependency. Mixed up with petro-masculinity, white patriarchy, and microfascism. Language such as "black lives matter" reformulated into "oil lives matter", and that fossil fuel usage is doing your patriotic duty, further overlaid with messages of white supremacy and racism and claims of victimization and "woke" agendas. Dystopian tactics but also perhaps indications of defensiveness from a dying industry.

In which themes from billboards around new residential suburbs in outer Melbourne are used to examine the Australian Dream of suburban home ownership. How do residents of these mass produced housing developments create communities (not a priority of planners and developers)? Infrastructure often lacking, reflected in lots of cars and car dependency. Some reflection of culture in outdoor ornamentation. Extensive lawns mostly replaced by tiny fake grass front lawns. Has the home become a focus for anxiety and alienation rather than a refuge from them?

In which thoughts on the new emerging field of spatial data science are discussed. Perhaps an extension of geoinformatics, with a huge increase in data sources and new methods to analyse using machine learning. Work often by people who do not have traditional geospatial backgrounds. So, how should teaching in this new field be done and how should course work be designed?

In which the patterns of misinformation and relationships between party politics in 26 Western countries are examined using 32 million Tweets. Findings are that populism is not specifically associated with misinformation. Generally not spread by right-wing parties or left-wing populists, but very associated with radical right-wing populists parties. Used as agenda-setting and control over public attention. Goals of left and right-wing populists are different, grievances against the "elite" vs seeking to overthrow democracy and replace with authoritarian leaders.

In which, the heat wave gap metric (time between two adjacent heat waves) was calculated for 1961-90 and 1991-2020 in New York City. Findings are that the gaps on average decreased by 15-41%. Number of shorter gaps (less than 5 days) increased 33-300% while longer gaps stayed roughly constant. Slight changes in typical atmospheric flow patterns are associated with the shortening gaps.

In which the stability of core political predispositions over a life-span are examined. Study (in 1999) covered the period 1940 to 1977, beginning at about age 30. Racial prejudices (antiblack attitudes) show remarkable persistence over a lifetime and their impacts on partisan alignments. Essentially, both remain stable throughout.

In which the (generally ignored) social and environmental impacts of generative artificial intelligence are discussed. Hardware (GPUs) and operations require huge amounts of minerals, energy, and water, followed by subsequent e-waste. Social impacts include noise, real estate space, electricity prices, and mining impacts. Authors recommend better quantification (transdisciplinary) of the lifecycle impacts and political and regulatory pressure to ensure these disclosures.

In which the reasons behind stagnating (and declining in recent years) life expectancies (over 1970-2014) in the US are examined. Highly associated with policies at a state level, with conservative states showing a reduction in life expectancies. If the liberal state policies had been in place across all states, life expectancies would be 2.8 and 2.1 years longer for woman and men. Policy categories include abortion, campaign finance, civil rights, criminal justice, education, environment, gun control, health/welfare, housing/transport, immigration, labor, taxes, and voting. Would be interesting to see the results from an analysis that also included COVID-19 (very deadly in red states).

In which the Microsoft AI Red Team evaluates the safety and security of 100 GenAI Microsoft products. Findings are that very simple methods generally work well (often better than sophisticated methods) to attack AI systems. AI harms are pervasive but hard to measure. LLMs add an extra level of security risks in addition to making existing ones worse. It will likely never be possible to secure AI systems. None of this seems like great news as everybody rushes to embed GenAI in everything.

In which research about how people change their beliefs about climate change provides a framework to facilitate greater acceptance of reality. Multiple theories try to explain why people adopt beliefs or are resistant to shifting their views. Process of shifting required a few steps. First is distancing from the community that influenced initial beliefs. Second, a desire to seek out information. Finally, the shift happened either gradually or as an epiphany. Interpersonal conversations can be influential in opinion shifts.

In which the impact of AI usage on cognitive skills is assessed. Cognitive offloading uses external tools to assist in reducing cognitive load, allowing reduced memory use and lighter engagement with a problem. Study finds 17-25 year olds higher AI tool usage and cognitive offloading and lower critical thinking scores. Frequent users of AI show dependence on these tools, reduced ability to problem solve, and show concerns over the transparency and bias of AI answers. Also, have some awareness of their dependency and reduced skills. Those with higher education sometimes fact check AI answers.

In which the potential for AI to address the "productivity crisis" is examined by looking at AI adoption in Canadian firms 2020-2021. (Time period doesn't include ChatGPT, introduced 2022).  Findings are that productivity gains from AI adoption are inconclusive (neither strong positive or negative relationship). No significant relationship was found between AI adoption and Total Factor Productivity levels or growth. Firms that did adopt AI were already more productive than those firms who didn't.

In which the impact of wildlife-friendly gardening practices on biodiversity across SW Australia is examined. Structures include bat and bird boxes, bird baths, frog hotels, possum shelters, ponds, and reptile shelters. Water sources (bird baths and ponds) are found to be especially important across a broad range of biodiversity. Many of the structures were used by not only the target species, but others as well. Bat boxes and frog hotels not particularly successful (might be design and placement problem). Reptile shelters used a bit more. Some structures shown to be of benefit to endangered species. Suburban gardens can play a role in biodiversity conservation.

In which the representation of water balances in 19 urban land surface models are tested in the Urban-PLUMBER intercomparion project. Indicators of water balance closure, evapotranspiration, storage, and runoff are used. Most models do not close water balance. Lack of irrigation in most models found to be a problem. For ET and storage, timing better captured than magnitude. Water storage schemes are often inconsistent. However, better water representation didn't necessarily lead to more accurate latent fluxes. Runoff often poorly captured. Overall evaluation is difficult because of limited observation datasets.

In which a framework to evaluate car dependency is developed with seven components. Components range from external to an individual (land use system, transport systems, natural environment) to internal (objective features - socio-economic, disability, mobility means or subjective features - perceived security on public transport). Crossover of components include temporal (car as time-saving, activity time requirements, service opening hours, transport service times) and social environment (living location, subjective norms, social responsibilities). Policy decisions around car dependency should consider the full range of components.

In which the racial prejudices of welfare systems is explained. Findings are that when whites perceive threats to their advantage in the hierarchy, minority resentment increases, driving decreased support for welfare programs (if they perceive benefits to minorities). Welfare backlash follows from perceptions of rising standing of minorities. I'm constantly amazed about how much of what drives American society seems confusing and illogical until you realize, oh, it is racism.

In which postdoctoral periods are examined for factors leading to career retention and success (transition from postdoc to faculty position). 41% of postdocs leave academia. Those who, as a postdoc or PhD student, have a hit paper (reflected in citation indexes) more likely to remain in academia. Slight changes in topic (widening research) are also helpful. Moving to another country also associated with broadening experience. New faculty hires more often when PhD is from a higher ranked institution, where postdoc hires more often moving to a higher ranked institution.

In which it is attempted to reverse engineer the Uber surge pricing algorithm. Findings are that the driver supply limitation is probably irrelevant, the main limitation is when compensation Uber offers drivers goes below vehicle operating costs (increased fares from surge pricing sometimes/often? not passed onto the driver and might actually decrease during these times to push drivers out of the available pool). Unregulated nature of Uber's business means Uber's price manipulations are opaque.

Estimated that 90% of existing UK homes will overheat under 2C climate change. Findings of large increases in vulnerability for pre-1900 housing, those with multiple deprivations. Some increases for small floor areas (<50m2) and older persons. Renters less adaptability to adapt. Heating and energy poverty is an issue that might be slightly mitigated by warming. But overall, existing vulnerabilities will likely be amplified by climate changes.

Members of the Greens party cycled the most (76%) with CVP (center right) at 73%. About 66% of SP (center left), FDP (right wing), and SVP (right wing populist). Unaffiliated at 33%. Most frequent cyclists leaned towards the left (but not exactly). Greens more frequently cycled for transport. Recreational only cyclists more often center and right. Left leaning parties tend to support cycling policy in proportion to their members where right leaning parties' policies are less supportive.

In which warming in relation to the Paris Agreement 1.5C target is discussed. 2024 was the first year of averages above 1.5C, but does that mean we have crossed the 1.5C threshold? Findings are that previous first year exceedences at 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0C have been the first year of 20 year periods above those levels. Therefore, without immediate strong climate mitigations, 2024 is likely to be the first year of 20 years above 1.5C. Current policy settings closest to SSP 2-4.5 where all models agree with passing the 1.5C threshold. Only SSP 1.9 or 1-2.6 possibly avoid this.

In which the impact of GenAI on critical thinking is quantified. Critical thinking includes knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Findings are that higher confidence in GenAI results are associated with less critical thinking. Reduced effort leads to less engagement with tasks. Authors recommend GenAI should create awareness of lack of critical thinking. I guess this is the system somehow forcing the user to think about what they are doing? I guess also knowledge workers are supposed to accept that they are responsible for whatever GenAI outputs and think critically about how the GenAI is working. Sounds pretty wishful and I assume people will just press the buttons and zone out, because they can.

In which the microclimates of artificial turf (AT) is measured and compared to grass. Findings are soil moisture under AT (AT is porous) decreased slower than grass, possibly greater resistance to vapour transport from compacted soil. Mean daytime air temperatures 0.6C and 0.8C higher than unirrigated/irrigated grass. Nighttime also higher. Vapour pressure differences smaller than instrument accuracy. Mean radiant temperature 1.2C higher. AT higher ground heat flux. Surface temperature 49.9C vs 31.7 and 29.9 average daytime means. Four hours per day, surface temperatures high enough to burn skin (15 seconds of contact), because lower albedos, lower specific heat capacity, lower evapotranspiration.

Positive net migration to sunbelt states (TX, FL, NC, AZ, TN, SC) continues. Some increased migration to WA, OR, CO, ID. Moving from NY, CA, IL. Overall dropping mobility. National mobility rate was 20% in 1948 -> 18% in mid-80s -> 10% in 2019. Local moves 15% in 1980s -> 8% in 2019. Sharpest declines among younger adults. Number of renting household increased while moving renters declined. Reasons behind declines might be ageing population, housing unaffordability, increasing dual income families, more working from home. Implications of Americans becoming less "worldly"?

In which certain "tortured phrases" are catalogued and used to detect paper mill publications. Paper mills churn out articles to boost 'publish or perish' statistics through falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism. "Spinners" disguise plagiarism through paraphrasing, replacements of "convolutional neural network" might end up as "convolutional brain organization".  Searched through recently published papers to catalog lists of these phrases to use as fingerprints. Finding substitutions such as "Electoral integrity" -> "Uprightness of the votes", "Centers for disease control and prevention" -> "Communities for infectious prevention and anticipation", and "Fraud" -> "Trickery in conduct". Scanning PubPeer with these phrases flagged a number of suspicious publications.

In which the shifts in tree ranges in the western US due to climate change are assessed. "Trailing edge/leading edge", the shift ("march") from warmer areas to cooler areas can lead to "contraction" if only one shift occurs without the other. Migration requires seed production and dispersal to new areas and successful growth of those new trees. Disturbances can enable migrations (removing competition by killing trees) but also eliminate seed sources. The 15 dominant species in the western US are undergoing losses due to disturbances and lack of regeneration in hotter areas. Assisted migration might be necessary to facilitate continued migration.

In which the emergence of the concept of stochastic terrorism is discussed. Influential individuals demonise target groups or individuals (i.e. the current demonisation of trans people), inspiring others to take up violence against them. Previously was the "lone wolf" terrorism, what provoked them to violence? A shift in who is the terrorist: the individual doing the violence or the one who inspired the violence (Fox News, Glenn Beck, etc)? How to characterise intent in terrorism? Can violent intent be pinned on the stochastic terrorist (plausible denialability, I had no idea my words would lead to this.)? Question of demonisation, definition is neural, not whether it is right or wrong to do it. So, should also include whether it includes misleadingness or deceitfulness. Dehumanising (already a tactic of authoritarianism) is also part of it. And stochastic terrorism becoming a tool of authoritarian politics. Also, include moral panics (the enemy within). All of the above must be considered in formulating counterterrorism. (But then again, the terrorism might be coming from in the house.)

In which motor vehicle crash costs are quantified. Divided into internal (individuals in crashes) and external costs (costs to victims, insurers, and government). Findings generally correspond with previous research (range of overall costs $0.02 to 0.08 per vehicle km). Their case study shows internal costs at $0.13/veh km and external of $0.079/veh km. Costs caused by drivers higher than those imposed on others. Highways generally safer than surface streets. Crash costs generally too low compared to travel time costs (valued at $18.30/hr), but drivers are not aware of these costs. And yes, policies should include incentives for safe driving.

In which current state of the art LLMs (o1, GPT4o, and Claude 3.5) are benchmarked against common software engineering coding problems using the SWE-Lancer benchmarker. If they can successfully solve all the problems in the benchmark, it should be worth the equivalent of 1 million USD in freelance work. Findings are that no LLM would earn more than $400,000. The best performing model (Claude 3.5) has a success rate of about 26%. Improving results often requires extensive "user tool" use (i.e. manual user intervention). The agents perform reasonably well in locating failure points (files or functions), but rarely identify root causes, leading to incorrect or insufficient solutions. So, replacing coders with current LLMs is probably not a good idea. (What's the cost to fix the 70% failure rates?)

In which the amount of space used for renewables across the world is compared to space allocated to golf courses. Authors counted 38,000 golf courses across the world (16k in the US), average size of 0.8km2. Significant increase in golf courses since 1985. Renewable requires 0.015km2/MW. So Canada 16x more golf space than renewables, 6x UK, 4x US, 1.25x Germany. Number of golf courses projected to grow. Energy justice, golf courses are exclusive while energy is a public necessity.

In which characteristics for pedestrian mobility in urban areas are examined. Traditional approaches are based on the DMA (Density, functional Mix, and Access) mix. Authors look at permeability through random walks on city sidewalks (porous leading to diffusion and calculations of net flow). Results align with Jacobs' observations of shorter edge lengths and more intricate network structure leads to higher diffusion. Applied to sidewalk networks of 3 cities, diffusion is unevenly distributed. Historic city core areas tend to have better permeability. Natural barriers (rivers) can lower permeability, but in the case of Paris, as urban structure organically developed over the years around the Seine has minimised the effects.

Modelling results of Tmrt from ENVI-met, TRNSYS, Ladybug/Honeybee, CitySim, and SOLENE-microclimat are compared. All of the tools are commercial (except Ladybug). Tmrt calculation method for ENVI-met is still not published. It probably neglects diffuse shortwave reflected by walls and albedos can only be set domain wide (as well as surface emissivities). Two hemisphere approach probably ok for pedestrian height but probably errors at greater heights (balconies). Ladybug documents Tmrt approach. Neglects longwave reflections and surrounding surfaces emissivities=1 (errors with glass or metal surfaces). And same possible height problem as above. CitySim might have errors with low-emissivity surfaces. TRNSYS is relatively complete. SOLENE-microclimat, no recent descriptions of calculations. Seems complete except multiple reflections.

In which the foraging activity of the superb lyrebirds (in SE Australia) are examined. They can be considered ecosystem engineers. They modify about 155 tons/ha/year while foraging for invertebrates. They mix, turn over, and aerate litter and soil layers, replenishing biomass and diversity of the prey (i.e. farming) and more than compensate for their offtake. The enhanced diversity and biomass has many positive implications (structure and function of forest ecosystems) and assist in responses to disturbances (wildfire).

New publication day: published in Urban Climate. We perform field investigations to assess children's outdoor thermal sensation votes (TSV) in winter, summer, and spring. We develop an artificial neural network model to predict children's TSV and compare the results to UTCI and multiple linear regression. As a result, the neural network can account for a wider range of inputs (clothing, metabolic rates, and ranges of ages, and body weights and heights) than traditional models. Sensitivity analysis also reveals the top influencing parameters are Tmrt, Tair, globe temperature, and metabolic rates.

New publication day: In which we use system dynamics modelling to look at how cities' transport systems impact their capabilities to mitigate mobility and health impacts of future large scale infectious disease outbreaks and extreme weather events. Results show that increased modal shifts towards active transportation create increased resilience against future shocks under three scenarios, mild shift (50% reduction of private auto use), medium (shift of 30% and 40% to bus and cycling), major (60% and 40% to cycling and walking). All scenarios reduced susceptibility to flooding (4-50% deaths prevented) with greater results from more ambitious shifts. Only the major shift produced reduced vulnerabilities to infectious disease outbreaks. Cities with compact designs and support active transport more likely to produce increased resilience to future shocks.

In which overall amounts of particulate matter (PM) from electric (EV) vs gasoline vehicles are analysed. Sources are exhaust emissions as well as tire and brake abrasion. Technology has reduced exhaust emissions while other sources have increased with increased road activity. Electric vehicles are heavier (approx 43%-battery, 29%-hybrids), so more tire emissions, but regenerative braking reduces brake PM emissions. For PM emissions to be less for EV, 15% of the travel must be city driving. For highway driving, traffic volume-to-capacity ratio should be at least 0.25 (i.e. more congested than free flowing).

In which the associations between temperature frequency and mortality under varying local ambient temperatures is assessed. Study calculated the most frequent temperature for 757 cities in 47 countries over 1979-2020. They find a linear relationship between temperature frequency and mortality risk, with the most frequent temperature having the minimum mortality risk. Possibly highest adaptation to the most common temperature. Large regional differences were found with AU and NZ lowest and S. Europe the highest. Higher increases in mortality in high income countries.

In which different policies to reduce plastic bag litter on US shorelines are evaluated across 2016-2023. In general, plastic bag litter on shorelines has increased in the study period. However, areas with plastic bag policies (bans, partial bans, or fees), there is a 25-47% decrease. Full bans and fees are most effective, where partial bans only have slight effects. Policies might also cause a 30-37% reduction in wildlife entangled in plastic.

In which informal taxi services in South Africa and how their coverage varies are examined. Inbound journeys tend to be more express with fewer pickup point. Outbound dropoffs are more dispersed (more individual dropoffs and search for new passengers). As a result, the inbound service area is about 40% smaller than the outbound leading to unequal service for those who have to walk further to board or have to travel in the wrong direction for some time.

In which the phenomenon of “instant justice” is examined. Introduction of the somewhat surreal and fragmented imagery and narrative structure of comics with mixed reading text and viewing images. In addition, speech is compact and densely figurative. Moves on to semiotics and how the Judge Dredd comic embodies "instance justice" as the "dream of law". Judge Dredd, an official superhero and superhero official. Other instances of instant justice are shown in The Trial (Kafka) and Traps (Dürrenmatt). There there is lots about Lucan that I don't quite understand.

In which the impact of using LLMs for writing is quantified. The expectation of being able to find information with web searches diminishes user's recall of information (search as learning). Cognitive load (CL) varies during web searches, higher during query formulation and relevance judgement. But more weighted toward recognition rather than recall. CL lower during LLM usage. Targeted answers reduce filtering effort. Task completion simplified, shift from active critical reasoning to passive oversight. Reduction in long term and deep engagement. During writing tasks, bypass of synthesis of material from memory (reduction of information retention and recall). Better task completion but no increase in knowledge. Reduction of creative writing abilities. Reduction of diverse perspectives (echo chamber of sources chosen by LLM).

In which lower stress cycling facilities are compared to standard bicycle lanes, using 6 years of data across 14,000 blocks in 28 US cities. Types of standard lanes (SBL), protected (PBL), buffered (BBL), and shared line markings (SHR). Installation of PBL and BBL strong increases in usage (1.8x SBL, 1.6x SHR, 4.3x no lanes). PBL mileage usage 52% stronger than SBL mileage and 281% than SHR. If you want to increase cycling, lower-stress facilities are necessary.

In which percolation theory is used to examine the hierarchical organisation of Australian urban areas using road network connectivity (OSM).
At the lowest resolution, most capital cities emerge. At higher thresholds, Victoria finds expansion of the Melbourne city centre, eventually joining up Ballarat and Geelong (previously manufacturing joined by railroad). In NSW, Sydney hasn't expanded, instead Newcastle becomes a second cluster along with Canberra. In WA, north and south Perth emerge and Qld and SA remain separate from other clusters. At higher thresholds, eventually VIC and NSW join until at even higher levels, SA and QLD also join. Throughout, FNQLD, NT, and WA remain unclustered. Eventually only a east/west divide (east coast super-cluster spanning Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane) remains along with disconnection of agricultural and mining centers.

From urban clusters to megaregions: mapping Australia’s evolving urban regions

In which (from 2004), the structure and form of Australian cities are described and how these structures present challenges for urban planning. Each originally colonial cities, green field with a central urban area providing all political, military, administrative, and commercial functions. Secondary cities in each state discouraged and dominated by the primary. In early planning, Sydney growth didn't follow the planning (topography related). Rail and roads in Brisbane allowed planning deviations. Melbourne and Adelaide planners more successful in imposing gridded plans (however later radial rail reduced the effectiveness). Perth and Adelaide less concentration of centralization. Public transit allowed rapid radial growth in Melbourne and Sydney. Post WWII, rapid population increases and migration from rural and motor vehicle enabled suburban growth. Technology, decentralisation drive recent trends. Early settlement form expected self-sufficiency (domestic production, waste, water). Suburban home ownership emphasised in recent years. These path dependencies cause present day planning difficulties.

In which population density trends in Australian capital cities from 1981-2011 are visualised. 1980s, growth was concentrated on suburban fringe and inner cities declined. 1990s tried to reverse inner city declines and reurbanise. But both suburbanisation and inner growth trends in the 90s highlighted that population growth and changing demographics occur simultaneously. And consolidation in the 2000s not always to plan. And transport linkages and infill may lead to density hot spots. Analysis shows in the period to 2011, some success in policies resulting in increased density beyond inner and middle rings and towards the outer fringes. Results are still somewhat premature but methodology can be applied in the future to determine updated trajectories.

Visualising 30 Years of Population Density Change in Australia’s Major Capital Cities

In which the forces that drive the city/country divide in Australia are examined. Australian states are all characterised by a primary dominant (economic, political, cultural) capital city. Paper looks at how power is distributed under federalism, finding strong federal and state governments and weak sub-state governments (in line with a lack of large non-capital cities). Regions dependent on top down initiatives. Repeated pushes for decentralisation have not resulted in significant changes. Constitution recognises two tiers of government, federal and state. Many state powers (i.e. fiscal) since encroached by federal. Local tiers not formally accounted for. Colonial origins probably built an over-reliance on stronger central resourceful government. Future change to these relations is hobbled by lack of institutions to support bottom up development and public sector reliance on grants and private capital restrictions. Decentralisation reform is subsequently unlikely.

In which experiments in cutting onions investigate droplet generation under different conditions (cutting speed, blade sharpness). Unsharpened knives generate droplets initially by internal pressurization then slower fragmentation of ligaments in air. Droplets concentrated nearly vertically with knife plane. Blade cutting speed and blade tip width increase number and energy of ejected droplets. Chilling onions before cutting had no effect on reducing onion emissions. Sharper blades reduce both number of droplets and speed and kinetic energy. This also applies to other fruits and vegetables with tough epidermal layers.

In which compliance with GDPR policies are tested. Websites are required to inform users about data collection and provide some consent or informed choices (i.e. cookie notices). Study developed a crawler to interact with cookie notices and discover subsequent data collection following preference choices. Of 97,000 websites, 56% do not include an opt-out option (reject). 65% still collect data despite negative consent. And 73% collect even when user doesn't interact with a notice. Additionally, they find that 26% of websites do not declare adequate data collection purposes in their cookie notices. Hmm, for most, don't provide a way to opt-out, and even if you do, just ignore that choice.

In which the bicycle network across Denmark is quantified into levels of traffic stress and spatial patterns of bikeability. Finding that high share of low-stress infrastructure but is mostly clustered in a few locations. Analysed 130,000 km network. 93% allows cycling, 89% includes cars. Bikeability based on density, fragmentation, and reach. Concentration of low-stress combined with high fragmentation results in low network reach outside of the highly populated areas. Rural roads can offer good long distance reach. Overall, high stress network 86% of the country (mostly low density areas, 27% of population). Small towns provide local low stress connectivity (6% network, 16% population). Regional low stress of 4% network (8% population). 2% of network (24% population) high bikeability in suburbs and medium towns. Smallest cluster of high bikeability and high density in 4 largest cities. Potential for increased rural cycling requires some investment.

In which cycling behaviour following a safety incident are examined. Previous research shows that willingness to cycle often follows a injury. A Random Forest is trained using 2500 incidents across the US. Most important factors for subsequent behaviour (biking less, more carefully, or stopping cycling) are hospitalisation, a collision, or being female. Authors success their model can help target interventions to provide post incident support.

In which the impact of autonomous vehicles (AV) are modelled using ABMs to determine potential impacts of travel modes (active transport) and increased sedentary behaviour. Study tries to account for the decision making process. In previous work, these are assumptions based on convenience, productivity, and reduced costs. Here based on survey results and using people, promoters, and public transport agents in ABM. Potential increased AV uptake driven by decreasing costs and acceptance of the technology. Causing decreases in active transport and increased sedentary transport behaviour. Extra fees for ride-hail reduced incentives. Purchases of AVs increased more by upfront discounts than post-purchase rebates. So, AVs look likely to be terrible for active transport.

In which GenAI has been promoted as a valuable educational tool, but how does this match teacher's experiences with its use in the classroom. Does GenAI free teachers from routine admin work?  Emphasis is on how to get useful output by 'promoting'. Do supermarket self-checkouts free employees, no, they spend their time babysitting the technologies. What work do teachers need to do when they are done 'prompting' and have the final result from the GenAI? Identified GenAI failures: out of date material, lack of localism, bland non-critical output, no context around pedagogy, mismatch of fit in with different student's levels and needs. Intervention needed because: teacher is ultimately responsible for the material, need to be ethical, need to add rigour, desire to be connected to teaching material. Limitations of GenAI in teaching shown by the amount of post-prompting interventions necessary and likely not capable of "doing" teaching tasks. Final comments on the dependencies in GenAI on hidden labor to produce the illustration of automation.

In which social vulnerability to climate change in terms of health impacts in Australia are examined. Develops multi-dimensional Social Vulnerability Index for the Health  Impact of Climate Change (SVI-HICC). Looks at differences following floods, fire, cyclones, and heatwaves from HILDA across previous and following year. Findings, regional and rural areas had higher vulnerability scores than capital cities. Regional SA, NT, and TAS highest social vulnerability to health from climate change, along with lower economic security, less infrastructure and services, less governance. And somewhat less population health and demographic structure.

In which secret shoppers are used to collect the health claims of CBD, THC or kratom by smoke shop employees in Texas. Visited in pairs, one asked questions, the other took phone notes, following a script. Claims made for THC of treating pain, insomnia, mental health. Kratom of drug withdrawl, pain, mental health. 1/4 of stores no mention of risks, often missed risks during pregnancy. Despite no FDA approved medical uses, employees routinely mentioned health benefits. Rarely provided comprehensive risk information or adverse effects or overdose risks. Research shows THC consumers have concerns over risks but store employees are rarely able to give this information.

In which the influence of cookies during an academic course evaluation (SETs) are quantified. Scores are potentially influenced by many factors: class size, course subject, instructor attractiveness, gender. In this study, chocolate chip cookies were used. Cookies were oversupplied (no limit of just one cookie each). Students with free access to cookies evaluated the teacher and course higher than those with no cookie access. Cookie availability explained 6.3% of the variation in scores. Limitation of mood changes due to chocolate also be a factor. Overall, study questions the validity of SETs as a metric in academic success.

In which pedestrian outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) of children is compared to adults. Thermal comfort measurements customarily taken at 1.5m. Children have higher metabolic rates, higher surface area to weight ratio, less developed sweat glands, and body core is closer to the ground than adults (and spend more time in non-standing activities). Study makes thermal comfort observations (PET) at 0.3, 0.7, 1.1, and 1.5m across a variety of land cover types, dense forest (DF), sparse forest (SF), lawn (LA), impervious pavement (IP), and synthetic rubber (SR). Large differences in surface temperature across types, ~45C between SR and DF. Air temperature varied across different heights across different types, 0.24C for LA compared to 1.02C for SR. PET 0.6C for IP and 0.16C for DF. For comparison, 1C PET increase increases heat mortality rate by 2.4%. Study used PET because most heat indexes are not appropriate for children.

In which a thought experiment examines when it would have been possible to first detect human influences on climate change. First discoveries of heat trapping CO2 in 1850-60s. Systematic surface temperature measurements from 1860s, weather balloons in 1892. When was the first linking of fossil fuels with climate change? Possible dates range from 1860 to 1986. Conclusion that 130 years ago is good choice. CMIP6 scenarios indicate that signal-to-noise (overcoming 11yr solar cycle, volcano eruptions, etc) would have been sufficient by 1894.

In which the social perceptions of using AI are examined. Hypothesis of negative evaluation of those using AI is upheld. Questioning of competence and motivations. Lower assessment of job candidates. Study 1, people using AI believe they will be evaluated as lazier, less competent, and less diligent. Study 2, confirms study 1 and finds perceptions exist. Study 3, managers who do not use AI act on negative assumptions about those using AI in hiring task. Study 4, perceptions of laziness mediate relationship between AI use and assessments of poor fit. Overall study is positioned as 'here are barriers to AI adoption' (and assumed productivity gains) and how people evaluate unfamiliar technologies.

In which the suitability to use smartwatches to measure urban heat is examined. Used 22 days across 2020-4 of observations in Sydney. Can sensors be embedded in wristwatches? Can a predictive model be developed? How do the predictions perform under different conditions? Observations compared to MaRTy measurements. Trained Random Forest model. Findings that wrist mounted sensors are not reliable, too influenced by body heat, and inaccurate in sunny and calm conditions. Developing a predictive model based on data from wearables is possible, the model and ML can compensate for the errors. Feature importance, wrist air temperature most important then wrist dew temperature. So, direct measurements from wearables are not great, but can be adjusted by models.
