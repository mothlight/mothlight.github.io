<center><h3><b>VTUF-3D setup</b></h3></center>


<p>The current version of VTUF-3D is 
 <a href="https://github.com/mothlight/VTUF-3D-Java.v2/">VTUF-3D Github</a>
<p>
There is an example.zip as part of the project. If you can get that
running correctly, then it should be possible to start setting up your
own configurations.

<p>
I modified the configuration scripts so that you can run it. I think
I replaced all the links to locations on my computer. So, there are two
files <a href="https://mediaflux.researchsoftware.unimelb.edu.au:443/mflux/share.mfjp?_token=pnWyJXQ7HMbsKmCeLSZV11282321497&browser=true&filename=ConfigurationMaker.zip">here</a>:
 <p>
The script in the VTUFTEST.zip file should set up a configuration and run the model. Starting with that might be a good way to start with the model.

<p><b>Update</b>: the Maespa.out executable doesn't run on newer versions of Ubuntu (i.e. 22.04). Use the Mapspa.out in this <a href="maespa.zip">zip file</a> instead. Code is also included if you need to compile it (make clean ; make ). You need to have gfortran installed.

<p>
VTUFTEST.zip should have all the things needed to generate a
configuration. You might need to change a few things in the
run_config.sh script. The Maespa executable was compiled for Ubuntu, so
needs to be run on something similar.
<p>
VTUFTEST_configured.zip is what you should have after setting up the
configuration.
<p>
I haven't updated the Fortran version in a long time and I don't intend
to in the future since the Java version now runs well enough. The most
complicated thing is probably to configure model runs, which I already
had lots of Java scripts to do. I've mostly used the model for my own
research so haven't had a chance (or time and funding) to set up a more
friendly configuration interface. So, I'm afraid there isn't much
documentation but more than happy to help you out and hopefully as part
of the process can start putting together better documentation.
<p>
If you look at <a href="https://github.com/mothlight/VTUF-3D-Java.v2/blob/main/src/VTUF3D/ConfigMaker/UrbanPlumberPhase2ConfigMaker.java">VTUF3D.ConfigMaker.UrbanPlumberPhase2ConfigMaker</a>, that's
how I've been generating configurations from the two data files the
project supplies. I'm sorry, the code is very messy and needs some major
refactoring, but I haven't had the time to do that yet.

<p>
This was in conjunction with the Urban Plumber evaluation <a href="https://urban-plumber.github.io/AU-Preston/">project</a>

<p>
So, as a first step, can you see if the example works for you and we can
go from there. VTUF-3D is a micro-scaled model, so is meant to be very 
detailed and might be complicated to use initially.
