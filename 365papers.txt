I did 365papers a few years ago. Lots of work but ultimately quite rewarding reading and writing about 365 papers over a year. So, I'll try again this year starting with this very recent paper. 
1/ #365papers 
In which a new module for the PUCM urban canopy model is developed, PUCM-mist, to model the impacts of misters. Modelling is performed for Phoenix and Houston (dry and humid climates), finding a flow rate of 0.1L/min can induce reductions in maximum canyon air temperature of 17.5C. Cooling is also seen in Houston, but about half that amount. Optimal cooling under intermediate wind speeds. Rapid cooling can be induced through the combination of misting and pavement sprinkling. Trying to wrap my head around the 17.5C, which is huge, but using lots of water and saturating the air, and altering both the potential maximum temperature and the time of day the maximum is reached.

In which the author (who is the founder of Sci-Hub) discusses different types of open access for scientific publications (and color codes), ranging from Sci-Hub (red), open access - PloS, MDPI, Frontiers (yellow/gold), preprints - arXiv (green), academic social networks - ResearchGate (blue). New categories beyond the green and gold ones established after the Budapest Open Access Initiative.

In which proposed policies (mass deportations, tariffs, reduced independence of the Federal Reserve) of a second Trump presidency are evaluated for their potential impacts on the US and global economy. Combined scenarios of high impact (60% tariffs with trading partner retaliations, 8 million deportations, no Reserve independence) could cause a 10% reduction in GDP and 7% inflation while lower impact (60% tariffs without retaliations, 1 million deportations, Reserve independence erosion) will still account for 3% reduction in GDP and 4% inflation.

3/ #365papers 

In which the impacts of tree planting projects for biomass storage at high northern latitudes are examined. The disturbances caused by albedo changes and the disruption of soil carbon storage will cause net warming and negative effects on Arctic biota and livelihoods. Tree planting can be great but the Arctic probably isn't the right place for it.

4/ #365papers 

In which, using wet-bulb temperature (accounting for humid heat) data across Mexico, high heat kills disproportionately more young people (especially under 5) than elderly (who more more vulnerable to cold). Children have higher body surface area, less developed immune systems, and less independence to express their discomfort. And young adults have higher exposure to high heat situations and less resources to adapt. Further, climate change is expected to drive increased disproportionate impacts.

5/ #365papers 

In which many questions and assumptions about urban scaling theory are addressed. Urban scaling started as identifying nonlinear relationships of urban growth relative to population. Contrasts are made between scaling and Zipf's and Gravity laws. How different definitions of cities effect them. Do they apply to past settlements? Interactions between cities. And the place of urban scaling in general urban science.

6/ #365papers 

In which the author examines (in 1955) how earthworms react to different water conditions (dry vs full immersion). Sort of trying to find why worms are found on pavement after rain. They show some resistance to desiccation.  
Some worms are found to be able to survive underwater for days or even weeks. Given a choice, some species seek air-filled soil while some go for water-filled soil.

7/ #365papers 

In which, in more recent earthworm research, some species show poor tolerance to water immersion and generally use more oxygen at night. Other species can survive longer underwater and have lower oxygen consumption and without a diurnal rhythm. So, why worms emerge from rain soaked soil at night might depend on which species and different oxygen needs.

8/ #365papers 

In which the rates of divorce (termination of a pair bond) of the Seychelles warbler are examined as influenced by weather. Findings are that increased divorces are preceded by years of low and high rainfall. It remains unclear whether this is adaptive, maladaptive, or neutral. Or can these behaviour changes help adapt to a changing climate?

#####

In which the increase in emissions to add AI generated answers (GPT-3) to Google search results is quantified. in 2009, Google search used about 0.0003 kWh per search (0.2g of CO2). Increased efficiency probably means current searches use 0.000004 kWh. Adding AI probably brings this up to 0.002 kWh, or about 100 times more. Further, while training AI is resource intensive, the subsequent use of ChatGPT dominates emissions.

10/ #365papers 

In which the openness of OpenAI (and AI in general) is examined. Findings are that most modern AI is dependent and controlled by a few large corporations. Openness mostly fails in the categories of transparency, reusability, and extensibility. Underlying hidden problem of colonialism - labor exploitation and cultural data sovereignty. Necessary computational resources close general access. AI might have a similar story to corporate dominance moves in open-source software, but some differences exist.

11/ #365papers 

In which the potential for the Kessler Syndrome (runaway debris growth in Earth's orbit rendering the space too dangerous/destructive for satellites and space travel) is examined and a framework for regulating/minimizing that. Mega-constellations (i.e. Starlink) have massively increased the risk. Will mandating shortening de-orbit rules be offset by the increased launches? Can spacecraft be strengthened to resist debris, and in turn create less debris?

12/ #365papers 

In which healthcare, in crisis particularly in the US and UK, could continue to degrade. With one path towards ever increasing efficiency, data collection, and technical mechanisation of healthcare, with increased involvement of retail and data corporations and lots of pharmaceuticals. Or the path (obviously favoured by the authors) to recognize the crisis as a crisis in care, requiring human responses and interactions. Going past what makes life possible to what makes living meaningful.
