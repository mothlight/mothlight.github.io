He2025="<p>While numerous thermal comfort models have been developed to predict human thermal comfort levels in outdoor areas under varying weather conditions, these indexes are generally designed for adults. To assess the suitability of thermal comfort models, the Universal Thermal Climate Index and a multiple linear regression (MLR) model based on Predicted Mean Vote factors, to predict children’s outdoor thermal sensation votes (TSV), field investigations were conducted in a Harbin park across multiple seasons. In addition, two new artificial neural network (ANN) models, with single and double hidden layers, were developed and validated to address a wider range of input parameters than the traditional models, clothing levels and metabolic rates, as well as accounting for a wider range of ages, body weights and heights. The results demonstrated that: 1) the ANN models outperformed the traditional models; 2) The two-hidden-layer ANN model slightly outperformed the one-hidden-layer model; 3) sensitivity analysis identified the top four parameters influencing the prediction of children’s TSV in Harbin as mean radiant temperature (0.259), air temperature (0.200), globe temperature (0.161), and children’s metabolic rate (0.110). These findings will offer valuable insights for optimizing thermal environments in urban parks, reducing children’'s thermal stress, and advancing intelligent park services.  </p><hr>";
LipsonICUC2025='<p>We present results from Phase 2 of the Urban-PLUMBER project, where we assess the ability to represent the surface energy balance across 30 land surface models at 20 sites, ranging from highly urbanised to highly vegetated. Our findings broadly support those of Phase 1, that community efforts have led to better representation of sensible and latent heat fluxes. However, at sites with higher impervious fractions (i.e. areas with little vegetation or bare soil), urbanised models tend to underestimate, and non-urbanised models overestimate the magnitude of observed latent heat fluxes, with urbanised models performing better overall. We find the performance of models without urban representation diverges at approximately 30% impervious fraction. </p><p>Our comparison with simple empirically based benchmark models indicates capacity for improvement in longwave radiation and momentum flux representation. Through this benchmarking methodology, we find this study’s group of models perform better than those in the original PLUMBER projects, which tested non-urban land surface models at non-urban sites. </p><p>The Urban-PLUMBER project has involved more than 60 contributing scientists, including those providing flux tower and meteorological data, undertaking simulations, developing models and evaluation methods. The observational forcing and benchmark data will be openly available, providing tools for future model development and modeller training. </p><hr>';
NiceICUC2025="<p>Growing adoption of integrated water management and urban greening strategies provide an opportunity for urban heat amelioration. Planning the use of and optimizing the benefits from these techniques, under present day and future climate conditions, requires suitable modelling tools. However, the Urban-PLUMBER project found that most land surface models fail to properly represent urban water processes (Jongen et al., 2024), including water balance closure, evapotranspiration, water storage, and surface runoff, leading to lower modelling performance. These shortcomings may be overcome by implementing a soil water balance model component into existing land surface models. Here, we adapted the soil water balance model, SIMPEL (Hörmann et al., 2007) for integration into land surface models. SIMPEL's stand-alone performance was evaluated against observations of turf grass irrigation trials conducted in 2021 and 2022 (Cheung et al., 2024) and showed good skill in predicting infiltration and soil moisture storage levels under a variety of precipitation and irrigation scenarios.</p><p>After the initial integration of the SIMPEL module into the TARGET local scaled model (Broadbent et al., 2019), TARGET shows increased accuracy compared to Phase 1 of the Urban-PLUMBER project (Lipson et al., 2023), using the Coutts et al. (2007) AU-Preston dataset.</p><p>As a standalone and computationally efficient model component, SIMPEL is suitable to be added as a module to a wide range of models to overcome the shortcomings found around water balance representation, ensuring water balance closure and internal water storage consistency. Future work is planned to improve the coupling with TARGET and to add SIMPEL to the VTUF-3D micro-scale model. Work is also planned to improve performance in urban sub-surface runoff representations.  </p><hr>";
MoralesICUC2025='<p>Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change, which continues to drive rising air temperatures. The morphology of a city also influences local climate through diverse surface properties and configurations, leading to varying responses to increasing air temperature trends. This study examines the impact of climate change on Santiago, Chile, a city in a valley characterised by a semi-arid climate. We analysed near-surface air temperature and rainfall data measured by the Chile Bureau of Meteorology stations sited in three different local climate zones (LCZ) over the last 63 years. The three LCZs were localised in the peri-urban, inner-city and residential areas. The methodology was conducted with regression analysis, a seasonal time series model, and standardised anomalies to assess temperature and rainfall trends. The results indicate a higher rate of warming and a greater decline in precipitation in the peri-urban area compared to the inner-city and residential areas, in addition to a doubling of the warming rate in recent years. The daily temperature range (DTR) exhibited a negative trend in the peri-urban area but a positive trend in the inner-city and residential areas, reflecting differences in the warming rates of maximum and minimum temperatures. Additionally, the peri-urban area displayed significant intra-annual variability in temperature and rainfall within the seasonal cycle. However, smaller temperature changes at the beginning of the study period were presented in the peri-urban area but much larger ones towards the end, in contrast to the other areas. Our findings underscore the accentuated impact of climate change in the peri-urban area due to its permeable surface characteristics without vegetation, compared to the areas dominated by impermeable surfaces with or without vegetation. It highlights the importance of analysing urban air temperatures based on LCZs, challenging the conventional urban-rural temperature difference paradigm that underpins urban heat island assessments.  </p><hr>';
Lilasathapornkit2025="<p>A range of factors influences cyclists' route choices, yet infrastructure design often fails to account for the diverse preferences and needs of different groups. This study examines cycling route choice preferences using revealed preference GPS data from Melbourne, Australia. Path Size Logit (PSL) and Mixed Path Size Logit models are estimated to capture path correlation due to overlapping routes and taste heterogeneity in route choice preferences among cyclist groups, segmented by age, gender, e-bike use, and Geller typology. Using a hybrid generalized Breadth-First Search on Link Elimination (BFS-LE) approach, the study enhances the quality and diversity of the generated choice set. Results indicate significant taste heterogeneity in route choices, with distinct preferences across cyclist segments: risk-averse cyclists—particularly women and the 'interested but concerned' group—showed a strong preference for protected bike lanes and off-road paths. In contrast, more confident cyclists, such as 'enthused and confident,' exhibited greater flexibility and were less sensitive to infrastructure types, slopes, and turns. Traditional bike riders were found to be more sensitive to infrastructure variability compared to e-bike users. Findings also revealed that cyclists, on average, perceived a 1% increase in the proportion of a route on an off-road bike path as equivalent to a reduction of 80 m in trip length, though this effect varied across individuals. Similarly, a 1% increase in the proportion of a route on a protected bike lane was, on average, equivalent to a reduction of 61 m, while each additional turn was perceived, on average, as adding 121 m, highlighting the variability in how route complexity influences cyclists' choices. Overall, the study offers valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers, emphasizing the need for inclusive cycling infrastructure that accommodates the diverse preferences of different cyclist groups to encourage broader participation. </p><hr>";
MarchionniJH2024='<p>Urban greening is essential for climate adaptation in cities, especially in regions with variable climates, where effective water management is crucial. This paper explores how Australian cities are pioneering strategies that integrate urban greening with water-sensitive urban design (WSUD), offering valuable lessons for other areas facing similar challenges. The analysis examines how diverse climate conditions across Australian cities impact urban greening and WSUD efforts, from Darwin’s tropical climate to Melbourne’s temperate and Perth’s Mediterranean environments. The paper highlights the role of water management in supporting resilient green infrastructure in major Australian cities, evaluating the integration of WSUD technologies such as bioretention basins, tree pits, green roofs, and vertical greening systems at various scales. Findings underscore the need for locally adapted solutions that account for species selection, water availability, and spatial context. Key challenges include mismatches in water supply and demand, maintenance demands, and the importance of community engagement. Existing modelling tools and metrics used to assess green space impacts in urban environments are reviewed, assessing their effectiveness and limitations within Australia’s unique contexts. By situating Australian practices in the broader global landscape of urban greening, the paper identifies best practices and lessons that can benefit other regions striving to create sustainable, climate-resilient urban spaces. Integrating water management into urban greening initiatives is emphasized as essential for their long-term success in adapting to climate change.  </p><hr>';
Thompson2020ModellingSARSCov3='<p>Background: For countries with strong border control and an epidemic that is not yet advanced, there is an opportunity to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 that is causing the COVID-19 pandemic. We show how public health policies and their effects can be modelled to estimate the probability of elimination of SARS-COV-2 under i) strict physical distancing policies implemented in New Zealand and Australia on the 26th and 28th March, respectively, continuing until such time that elimination is achieved; and ii) the same policy, but with physical distancing decaying over 60 days to 26th and 28th of May.<p>Methods: We developed an agent-based SEIR model that simulated key aspects of both country’s populations, disease, spatial and behavioural dynamics, as well as the mechanism and effect of public health policy responses on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. <p>Findings: Under maintained strong physical distancing, we estimated a median elimination date of July 12th for Australia (95% SI: June 5th to August 28th) and June 3rd for New Zealand (95% SI May 4th to June 27th). A 90% probability of elimination is achievable in Australia on August 17th (95% SI: August 8th – August 30th) and on June 14th (95% SI: June 17th – June 29th) in New Zealand. <p>However, under our scenario of decaying adherence to physical distancing from implementation to 60 days post restrictions, a rebound in SARS-CoV-2 infections (i.e., a second wave) was likely in Australia and possibly in New Zealand. At 100 days, the probability of elimination was reduced to 10% in Australia and 68% in New Zealand. <p>Interpretation: The findings suggest that with the effective implementation and maintenance of public health policies limiting physical interaction, it was possible to estimate a pattern the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in both countries. It seems highly likely NZ will have successfully eliminated as of 8 June, but not in Australia; the latter is consistent with our lower probabilities that modelled less stringent restrictions applied in Australia.  </p><hr>';
Seneviratne2022UrbanFeature='<p>Analysis of overhead imagery using computer vision is a problem that has received considerable attention in academic literature. Most techniques that operate in this space are both highly specialised and require expensive manual annotation of large datasets. These problems are addressed here through the development of a more generic framework, incorporating advances in representation learning which allows for more flexibility in analysing new categories of imagery with limited labeled data. First, a robust representation of an unlabeled aerial imagery dataset was created based on the momentum contrast mechanism. This was subsequently specialised for different tasks by building accurate classifiers with as few as 200 labeled images. The successful low-level detection of urban infrastructure evolution over a 10-year period from 60 million unlabeled images, exemplifies the substantial potential of our approach to advance quantitative urban research. </p><hr>';
Hunter2023ComputerVision='<p> Background: Given that the majority of the world’s population live in cities, it is essential to global health efforts that we design them in ways that both reduce non-communicable diseases (NCDs) risk and that facilitate adoption and maintenance of healthy lifestyles. Current approaches tend to focus on the relationship between urban design-related factors that affect health at the local or neighbourhood level but few studies have explored this relationship both within and across entire cities, nor explored the causal pathways between urban-designed related factors and NCDs. The aim of this research program is to use computer vision, causal inference, and public health modelling methods for understanding the causal relationship between urban design and health at the neighbourhood level, and to explore intervention approaches at the city scale.<p>Methods: Phase 1 will use machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyse gridded, local-level aerial images (with an optical resolution of <20cm), of all UK and Australian cities with populations over 100,000. It will identify a variety of urban features within these images and derive associations between them and NCD incidence and risk factors identified through location-based health surveys. Phase 2, using data from prospective health cohorts and linked objective built environment data, will apply Bayesian networks to investigate the possible causal pathways between built environment, lifestyle factors, and NCD incidence. Phase 3 will estimate the health impacts of actionable changes in urban design. Using health impact assessment modelling, we will calculate the NCD burden that could be prevented if cities were to adopt urban features of healthier counterparts. A similar approach will be applied on finer-grained scale within all case study cities, enabling assessment of health impacts of changes in individual locations. Phase 4 will develop an interactive web-based toolkit to enable urban designers, planners and policymakers to inform the decision-making cycle, co-designed with intended users involving participatory workshops.<p>Discussion: We use state-of-the-art approaches to: (i) generate evidence on the impacts of urban planning and design in NCDs and health inequalities in UK and Australian cities, and (ii) provide stakeholders with tools for advocacy and designing healthier cities.  </p><hr>';
Nice2018HumanSettlement='<p>  In an impending urban age where the majority of the world’s population will live in cities, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing city designs to ensure they are safe, clean, can deliver health co-benefits and importantly, are sustainable into the future. To enable this, a systematic and efficient means of performing inter- and intra-city comparisons based on urban form is required. Until now, methods for comparing cities have been limited by scalability, often reliant upon non-standardised local input data that can be costly and difficult to obtain. To address this, we have developed a unique approach to determine the mix, distribution, and composition of neighbourhood types in cities based on dimensions of block size and regularity, sorted by a self-organising map. We illustrate the utility of the method to provide an understanding of the underlying city morphology by overlaying spatially standardised city metrics such as air pollution and transport activity across a set of 1667 global cities with populations exceeding 300,000. The unique approach reports associations between specific mixes of neighbourhood typologies and quantities of moving vehicles (r=0.97), impervious surfaces (r=0.86), and air pollution levels (aerosol optical depth r=0.58 and NO2 r=0.57). What this illustrates, is that this unique approach can identify the characteristics and neighbourhood mixes of well-performing urban areas while also producing unique ‘city fingerprints’ that can be used to provide new metrics, insights, and drive improvements in city design for the future.</p><hr>';
Zhao2019StreetscapeFactors='<p>Cycling is associated with health, environmental and societal benefits. Urban infrastructure design catering to cyclists’ safety can potentially reduce cyclist crashes and therefore, injury and/or mortality. This research uses publicly available big data such as maps and satellite images to capture information of the environment of cyclist crashes. Deep learning methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), learn from these datasets and explore factors associated with cyclist crashes. This assumes existing environmental patterns for roads at locations with and without cyclist crashes, and suggests a deep learning method is able to learn the hidden features from map and satellite images and model the road environments using GANs. Experiments validated the method by identifying factors associated with cyclist crashes that show agreement with existing literature. Additionally, it revealed the potential of this method to identify implicit factors that have not been previously identified in the existing literature. These results provide visual indications about what streetscapes are safer for cyclist and suggestions on how city streetscapes should be planned or reconstructed to improve it.</p><hr>';
Traill2024='<p> Climate change, rapid urbanisation, and ageing populations are reinforcing the need for urban heat mitigation techniques. Pavement watering is one such technique, where evaporative cooling is induced through wetting urban surfaces. The aim of this research is to assess the potential cooling benefits of pavement watering. To do this, a 10x10m section of a car park was watered, and experiments were conducted at midday, the afternoon, and the evening across three days. Pavement watering was found to induce a mean cooling of up to 0.6C in air temperature and 2C in UTCI at 1.5m. Benefits were related to prevailing conditions, with lower wind speeds associated with greater cooling. Surface temperature was also found to decrease by up to 9.0C, and the surface energy balance of the watered carpark was characteristic of a highly evaporative surface. However, there were limitations of the experiments; notably, the assumptions made to correct observations increased uncertainty, and the small scale of the experiment likely limited the observed cooling benefits. Despite this, pavement watering was shown to reduce air temperature and surface temperature, as well as improve thermal comfort, and thus may potentially be used in emergencies to provide cooling in urban areas.</p><hr>';
Nice2017DevelopmentVTUF="<p> With urban areas facing future longer duration heat-waves and temperature extremes from climate change and growing urban development, adaptation strategies are needed. Examining the role that increased tree cover and water availability can have on human thermal comfort (HTC) in urban areas as part of these strategies has been done using observations, but further work requires a modelling tool suited for this task. Sufficient model resolution is needed to resolve variables used to calculate HTC, as well as the ability to model the physiological processes of vegetation and their interaction with water and with the rest of the urban environment. The lack of such a model has been identified as a research gap in the urban climate area and has impaired the ability to fully examine the use of urban greenery and water for improved human thermal comfort.</p><p>A new model, VTUF-3D (Vegetated Temperatures Of Urban Facets), addresses this gap by embedding the functionality of the MAESPA tree process model (Duursma & Medlyn 2012), that can model individual trees, vegetation, and soil components, within the TUF-3D (Krayenhoff & Voogt 2007) urban micro-climate model. An innovative tiling approach, allows the new model to account for important vegetative physiological processes and shading effects using configurable templates to allow representation of any type of vegetation or water sensitive design feature. The high resolution of VTUF-3D is sufficient to examine the processes that drive human thermal comfort (HTC). This allows detailed calculations of surface temperatures, mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), and a HTC index, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI), across an urban canyon.</p><p>An extensive validation process, using three different observation data sets to validate a number of different and key aspects of the VTUF-3D model, has shown it performs well and is suitable for use to examine critical questions relating to the role of vegetation and water in the urban environment.</p><p> A demonstration of the model using modelling scenarios of varying canopy cover shows that average peak daytime HTC improvements of 1◦C UTCI (and 2.3◦C UTCI) are possible in doubling (and quadrupling) existing street cover canopies, with localised effects under canopy cover approaching 5◦C UTCI. These scenarios also show the value of the existing canopy cover, as reductions and elimination of existing cover can create reductions in HTC of 2◦C UTCI. In addition, reductions in average air temperature (Ta) across urban canyons can differ by 1◦C between streets with differing canopy cover.</p><p> After the development, validation, and demonstration of this new model, it is now possible to conduct further analysis to quantify the impact each individual tree can have on temperatures in urban canyons. Further, the model can help inform the optimal arrangement and quantity of trees to maximise temperature moderation effects and be used to generate best practices guidelines for urban greening. </p><hr>"
Nice2011MicroClimateParklands="<p>Progression of climate change, with its predicted intensification of temperature extremes and heat wave durations, combined with demographic trends towards increased urbanization makes the study of urban micro-climates desirable. Understanding of mixed urban parkland morphologies leads to insights into possible adaptation and mitigation strategies to minimize impacts due to temperature extremes and UHI (urban heat island) on human health. Observational methodologies to study these environments present difficulties in obtaining data of sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, and are expensive and time consuming as well. Modelling using mathematical computer simulations addresses some of these concerns. However, confidence in the results obtained from models requires verification of accuracy. Merely observing that the modelling output looks plausible isn't enough. Verification of underlying processes and their interactions are ultimately necessary for complete confidence.</p><p> Data collected in a mixed urban parkland study area was analysed for spatial and temporal temperature variations. Urban micro-climate drivers such as incoming shortwave radiation, wind, and humidity played a role in the variations across the area. Wind was found to be an important driver. It moderated afternoon maximums through mechanical mixing at solar exposed sites as effectively as tree cover shading did at other sites. At the same time, heat was allowed to build at wind sheltered sites. Calming winds also contributed to dropping temperatures after dusk and warming temperatures in pre-dawn hours coinciding with increasing wind speeds. On average, temperatures in parkland areas were found to be 2°C cooler than urban areas.</p><p> Modelling of this study area was carried out using ENVI-met, a urban micro-climate model. However, ENVI-met's ability to predict the temperature gradients seen in the observations was hampered by constant values, both spatial and temporal, in wind speed and humidity levels. As these were found to be important components in driving spatial temperature variability in the observations, these constant values are unable to drive variabilities as they would have in the observations. Temperature variations lag behind observed values and temperatures are also under-predicted during the day and over-predicted at night. This leads to low confidence levels about ENVI-met's accuracy in resolving temporal and spatial temperature variation and yields an inconclusive result as far as modelling predictions are concerned.</p><hr>"
Xu2024='<p>The fusion of multi-source data is essential for a comprehensive analysis of geographic applications. Due to distinct data structures, the fusion process tends to encounter technical difficulties in terms of preservation of the intactness of each source data. Furthermore, a lack of generalized methods is a problem when the method is expected to be applicable in multiple resolutions, sizes, or scales of raster and vector data, to what is being processed. In this study, we propose a general algorithm of assigning features from raster data (concentrations of air pollutants) to vector components (roads represented by edges) in city maps through the iterative construction of virtual layers to expand geolocation from a city centre to boundaries in a 2D projected map. The construction follows the rule of perfect squares with a slight difference depending on the oddness or evenness of the ratio of city size to raster resolution. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to assign accurate PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations to roads in 1692 cities globally for a potential graph-based pollution analysis. This method could pave the way for agile studies on urgent climate issues by providing a generic and efficient method to accurately fuse multiple datasets of varying scales and compositions.</p><hr>'

Cheung2024IrrigationTiming='<p>The increasing heat stress in cities due to climate change and urbanisation can prevent people from using urban green spaces. Irrigating vegetation is a promising strategy to cool urban green spaces in summer. Irrigation scheduling, such as daytime vs night-time irrigation and the frequency of irrigation in a day, can influence the cooling benefit of irrigation. This study aimed to investigate whether irrigation scheduling can be optimised to increase the cooling benefit and determine how the cooling benefit changes with weather conditions. A field experiment with twelve identical turfgrass plots (three replicates × four irrigation treatments) was set up to measure the afternoon cooling benefits of irrigation. The four treatments included: no irrigation, single night-time irrigation (4 mm d–1), single daytime irrigation (4 mm d–1) and multiple daytime irrigation (total = 4 mm d–1). The cooling benefit was defined as the air temperature difference measured at 1.1 m above the turfgrass between the irrigated and unirrigated treatments (air temperature sensor accuracy ± 0.2 °C). The afternoon (12:00–15:59) mean cooling benefit of multiple daytime irrigation (–0.9 °C) which was significantly stronger than that of single night-time irrigation (–0.6 °C) and single daytime irrigation (–0.5 °C). Regardless of irrigation scheduling, the afternoon mean cooling benefits of irrigation were greater for days when background air temperature, vapour pressure deficit and incoming shortwave radiation were greater. The findings suggested that irrigation scheduling can be optimised to increase the cooling benefit of urban green space irrigation without increasing overall water use.</p><hr>'
Garcia2024='<p>Background: The world faces increasing risk of more frequent and larger scale natural hazards, including infectious disease outbreaks (IDOs) and climate change-related extreme weather events (EWEs). These are expected to adverse city mobility and public health impacts, with people living in cities especially vulnerable. Little is known about how transport systems can be optimally designed to make cities more resilient to these hazards. Our aim was to investigate how cities’ transport systems, and their resulting mobility patterns, affect their capabilities to mitigate mobility and health impacts of future large-scale IDOs and EWEs. <p>Methods: System dynamics modelling was employed to investigate how different city mobility scenarios can affect the health and mobility impacts of four plausible future IDO and EWE (flooding) shocks in three cities: Belfast (UK), Belo Horizonte (Brazil) and Delhi (India). Three alternative city mobility scenarios with incremental degrees of modal shift towards active travel (private motor vehicle volume reduced to 50% and 20% of total road trip volume in scenario 1 and 2, and motor vehicle volume (including bus) reduced to 20% of total road trip volume in scenario 3) were tested. For each city and each IDO and EWE shock, we estimated the percentage of deaths prevented in scenario 1, 2, and 3, relative to the reference scenario, as well as changes in mode share over time. <p>Findings: In all scenarios, all cities showed reduced susceptibility to flooding, with 6% to 47% deaths potentially prevented depending on case city, city mobility, and EWE scenario. The more ambitious the transition towards healthier city mobility patterns, the greater the resilience against flooding. Only scenario 3 (the most ambitious transition) showed reduced vulnerability to IDOs, with 6% to 20% deaths potentially prevented depending on case city, city mobility, and IDO scenario. Evolution of mode shares varied greatly across cities and mobility scenarios under the IDO shocks. <p>Interpretation: Our results emphasize the importance of well-designed, forward-thinking urban transport systems that make cities more resilient and reduce the impact of future public health- and climate-related threats.</p><hr>'
Hunter2024='<p>Background: Policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed city mobility patterns, including active transportation, creating a unique opportunity for global public health lessons and action. We analyzed a global natural experiment exploring city mobility patterns during the pandemic. <p>Methods: Apple’s Mobility Trends Reports were analyzed from 296 cities during the pandemic. We synthesized global pandemic policies and recovery actions that impacted active transportation using the Shifting Streets Dataset. The public health equity of policies was investigated using PROGRESS-plus framework. Multivariate regression explored whether active transportation policies influenced city mobility patterns. Finally, a natural experiment on a global scale evaluated the effect of new active transportation policies on walking and public transit use in selected case-study cities. <p>Findings: Overall, we observed a decline in all mobility indices (walking, driving, public transit) at the beginning of the pandemic, but the values began to increase in April 2020. Cities with lower population density had higher driving and walking indexes than cities with higher population density, while cities with higher population density had higher public transit indexes. Cities with higher COVID-19 infection rates had higher driving and walking indexes than cities with lower COVID-19 infection rates, while cities in Q2 COVID-19 infection rates had higher public transit indexes than other cities. Policies were implemented in 230 cities within 33 countries (including 19 high-income, 11 middle-income, and 3 low-income). For the global experiment (including 36 cities), setting the intervention point in mid-April 2020, the absolute value of the walking index was significantly higher after the policy intervention (Coef. = 23.105; SE = 3.253), and the increase of the walking index after the policy intervention was higher than the decrease of the walking index before the policy intervention (Coef. = 22.378; SE = 1.774). <p>Interpretation: Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining and expanding policies implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, which changes city mobility patterns, including increased active transportation. Improving infrastructure to promote safe walking, cycling, and access to public transit use should be prioritized in low and middle-income countries for equitable future-proofing of cities from global pandemics. </p><hr>'
NiceLPH2024="<p>Rapid declines in city mobility saw reductions in exposure to transport-related air pollution and associated health risks during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 as many cities introduced non-pharmaceutical interventions designed to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, these benefits soon reversed in the pandemic's `Recovery' phase (Sep. 2020 onward), especially in cities whose designs afforded mode-shift away from public and active transport in favour of private motor vehicles. The aim of this paper was to understand the association between global city designs, transport mode choice, and population-level risk exposure during 2020.</p><p>Graph networks were used to identify city design types based on road and transport infrastructure in 507 global cities. Comparisons between city types were made on the basis of transportation mode shifts, air pollution levels, and associated health outcomes (i.e., cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, respiratory disease, asthma, and reported COVID-19 cases) throughout 2020. City designs demonstrating sustained reductions in transport-related air pollution associated with reduced risk of acute and chronic disease outcomes were identified.</p><p>The mean observed reductions in global NO2 and PM2.5 levels across observed cities in the early months (mid Feb. 2020 to Apr. 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic were 5.36% and 16.19%, respectively. NO2 reductions were estimated to have had a positive impact on population health, equating to an estimated reduction in all-cause mortality of approximately 3% had the deepest pollution reductions observed in the `Early-crisis' phase (mid Jan to Feb 2020) been sustained globally, over the long term. Similarly, it would be expected that reductions in PM2.5 levels during this same period would translate into substantial asthma risk reductions of between 19% and 65% and all-cause mortality of between 13.2% and 24.6%. In the later stages of 2020, city designs (primarily in the Americas and Oceania) that afforded a mode shift away from public transit to private motor vehicles during the pandemic's `Recovery' phase tended to demonstrate the poorest outcomes across all air pollution and health measures, even increasing risk levels above pre-pandemic baselines in some cases. By contrast, cities located in Japan and Korea demonstrated little change in pre- and post crisis transport mode choice, maintaining comparatively low levels of air pollution, associated disease risk, and reduced rates of infectious disease transmission throughout the observation period. Contrasting experiences of road injury in the post-pandemic phase (post 2020) are also observed between these locations.</p><p>This study illustrates the transient environmental and health benefits observed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by significant reductions in transport-related air pollution and associated health risks due to imposed non-pharmaceutical public health interventions. City design appears to have played a crucial role in observed pollution and health risk differences between cities, with those that afforded a shift away from public and active transport towards private vehicles witnessing a rapid erosion of pollution-related health benefits gained in the early to mid-phases of the pandemic. These negative effects appear to have also transferred through to rates of road trauma with a resurgence in road injury above pre-pandemic levels, particularly within countries reliant on private motorised transport. Conversely, cities in Japan, South Korea, and select European regions, which did not experience modal shift toward cars sustained reductions in air pollution and have continued a trend of declining road transport injuries. This underscores city design as a significant factor in navigating pandemic-related challenges and suggests city designs containing higher levels of public and mass transit appear to demonstrate greater levels of resilience in the face of infectious disease threats. </p><hr>"

Existing studies lack robust spatial and/or temporal coverage, and are also subject to sampling biases, which are more critical for bicycling than other travel modes. Additionally, accurately detecting bicycling trips from continuously collected raw GPS data without the need for human intervention remains a challenge. This study presents a novel GPS data collection method by leveraging the combination of a smartphone application with a Bluetooth beacon that captures bicycling trips with high recall without the need for participant intervention, carefully optimising between survey participation, privacy challenges, participant burden, and robust bicycling trip detection. Our method is applied to collect 19,782 bike trips from 673 users spanning eight months in Greater Melbourne, Australia. The collected dataset represents the underlying adult bicycling population in terms of gender, employment status, certain occupation categories, and the spatial distribution of trips. The average trip length (median=4.8 km), duration (median=20.9 min), and frequency of bicycling trips (median=2.7 trips/week) were greater among men, middle-aged and older adults. The `Interested but Concerned` cyclists (as classified using the Geller typology) rode more frequently, while the `Strong and Fearless` and the `Enthused and Confident` groups rode greater distances and for longer.</p><hr>'
Cheung2024UCMechCooling='<p>High temperatures in summer can prevent people from using urban green spaces. Irrigating urban green spaces is a promising strategy to reduce temperatures. In this study, we aimed to a) identify the proportional contribution of different irrigation cooling mechanisms and b) quantify the impacts of different irrigation amounts (from 2 to 30 mm d−1) on the cooling effect of irrigating turfgrass in Melbourne, Australia. We first used a field experiment in Melbourne to provide empirical data to calibrate and verify the performance of an urban ecohydrological model, UT&C. Then, we used UT&C to predict the impacts of irrigating turfgrass on evapotranspiration, the energy balance and microclimate. UT&C predicted that irrigating turfgrass 4 mm d−1 would increase the evaporation from grass canopy and soil surface by 0.2 and 0.6 mm d−1, respectively, whereas it would reduce transpiration by 0.6 mm d−1 due to intercepted water covering part of the grass canopy following the irrigation. UT&C predicted that daytime (10:00–16:59) mean air temperature reductions would increase from 0.2 to 0.4◦C when the irrigation amount increased from 2 to 4 mm d−1. However, increasing the irrigation amount beyond 4 mm d−1 would not increase the cooling benefits.</p><hr>'
Godic2024='<p>Objective: Associations between place and population health are of interest to researchers and policymakers. The objective of this paper is to explore, summarise and compare content across contemporary Australian geo-referenced population health survey data sets. <p>Methods: A search for recent (2015 or later) population health surveys from within Australia containing geographic information from participants was conducted. Survey response frames were analysed and categorised based on demographic, risk factor and disease-related characteristics. Analysis using interactive Sankey diagrams shows the extent of content overlap and differences between population health surveys in Australia. <p>Results: Thirteen Australian geo-referenced population health survey data sets were identified. Information captured across surveys was inconsistent as was the spatial granularity of respondent information. Health and demographic features most frequently captured were symptoms, signs and clinical findings from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems version 11, employment, housing, income, self-rated health and risk factors, including alcohol consumption, diet, medical treatments, physical activity and weight-related questions. Sankey diagrams were deployed online for use by public health researchers. <p>Conclusions: Identifying the relationship between place and health in Australia is made more difficult by inconsistencies in information collected across surveys deployed in different regions in Australia. <p>Implications for Public Health: Public health research investigating place and health involves a vast and inconsistent patchwork of information within and across states, which may impact broad-scale research questions. The tools developed here assist public health researchers to identify surveys suitable for their research queries related to place and health.</p><hr>'
Nice2024IWMCooling='<p>The process of urbanisation has increased public health risks due to urban heat, risks that will be further exacerbated in future decades by climate change. However, the growing adoption of integrated water management (IWM) practices (coordinated stormwater management of water, land, and resources) provides an opportunity to support urban heat amelioration through water supply provision and irrigated and vegetated infrastructure that can provide cooling benefits. This study examines the thermal impacts of future implementations of IWM for nine Australian cities based on a review of Government policy documents in the present and over two future time frames (2030 and 2050) under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSPs 1.2-6, 3.7-0 and 5.8-5). Statistical analysis of the future climate data using historical data shows that future warming is nuanced, with changes variable in both time and place, and with extremes becoming more pronounced in future. We have developed a unique approach to morph the future climate projections onto historical data (derived from the ERA5 Reanalysis product) for the 2010-2020 period. Additionally, we use locally appropriate Local Climate Zones (LCZs) for Australian cities, resulting from a holistic and global approach that is widely adopted by the urban climate modelling community. We developed scenarios for business-as-usual as well as implementation of moderate and high levels of IWM across each of the Australian LCZs and modelled them using TARGET (The Air temperature Response to Green infrastructure Evaluation Tool). Results generated at the LCZ level are aggregated to Australian statistical areas (SA4, the largest sub-city area) and city-wide levels. The thermal impacts associated with the various degrees of IWM were marked and geographically differentiated, depending on the climatic characteristics of the various cities. For the current climate, high IWM intervention provided reductions in annual mean daily maximum temperature ranging from -0.77C in Darwin, up to -1.86C in Perth.  Generally, the drier southern cities of Sydney, Canberra, Albury, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth produced the greatest thermal response to implementation of IWM and the more tropical cities with higher rainfalls the least response. For some southern cities cooling was > -3.0 C at the time of maximum summer temperatures. Interestingly high levels of IWM in winter produced modest warming of minimum overnight temperatures, especially for the cooler southern cities. The cooling benefits of IWM were seen across all future climate scenarios and are a real opportunity to offset-projected temperature increases resulting from climate change.</p><hr>'
Chen2024='<p>Problems caused by urban heat have prompted the exploration of urban greenery for heat mitigation. Various numerical models can simulate related processes, but their use as support-tools to urban planners remains underexplored, particularly at the city-scale. This study investigates the spatial relationships between urban heat, urban form and urban greenery with the fast microclimate model TARGET (The Air-temperature Response to Green/blue-infrastructure Evaluation Tool). Using the City of Zurich as our case study, we : (1) validated the TARGET model against crowd-sourced temperature measurements, (2) performed a sensitivity analysis to identify key variables affecting urban heat, and (3) investigated urban heat relationships with greenery presence along major pedestrian routes. Presence of urban greenery across the region shows potential for reducing local air temperatures by up to 2 °C. Investigating this relationship along transects through the city revealed key districts that should potentially be targeted for pedestrian impact reduction, due to their high pedestrian traffic, low greenery presence and high daytime air temperatures. Our results not only provide insights into the cooling effect of different amounts of greenery in the urban environment, but also demonstrates the application and integration potential of models like TARGET to support the planning of more liveable future cities.</p><hr>'
Beck2022Network='<p>Numerous studies have explored associations between bicycle network characteristics and bicycle rider­ ship. However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in inner metropolitan regions and as such, there is limited knowledge on how various characteristics of bicycle networks relate to bicycle trips within and across entire metropolitan regions, and how the size and composition of study regions impact on the association between bicycle network characteristics and bicycle ridership. We conducted a retrospective analysis of household travel survey data and bicycle infrastructure in the Greater Melbourne region, Australia. Seven network metrics were calculated (length of the bicycle network, betweenness centrality, degree centrality, network density, network coverage, intersection density and average weighted slope) and Bayesian spatial models were used to explore associations between these network characteristics and bicycle ridership. We demonstrated that bicycle ridership was associated with several network characteristics, and that these characteristics varied according to the outcome (count of the number of trips made by bike or the proportion of trips made by bike) and the size and characteristics of the study region. These findings challenge the utility of approaches based on spatially modeling network characteristics and bicycle ridership when informing the monitoring and evaluation of bicycle networks. Further efforts are required to be able to quantify network characteristics that reflect the myriad of factors that influence comfort and safety for people of all ages and abilities.</p><hr>'
Lipson2023UrbanPlumber1='<p> Accurately predicting weather and climate in cities is critical for safeguarding human health and strengthening urban resilience. Multi-model evaluations can lead to model improvements, however there have been no major intercomparisons of urban-focused land surface models in over a decade. Here, in Phase 1 of the Urban-PLUMBER project, we evaluate 30 land surface models` ability to simulate surface energy fluxes critical to atmospheric meteorological and air quality simulations. We establish minimum and upper performance expectations for participating models using simple information-limited models as benchmarks. Compared with the last major model intercomparison at the same site, we find broad improvement in the current cohort`s predictions of shortwave radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, but little or no improvement in longwave radiation and momentum fluxes. Models with a simple urban representation (e.g. “slab” schemes) generally perform well, particularly when combined with sophisticated hydrological/vegetation models. Some mid-complexity models (e.g. “canyon” schemes) also perform well, indicating efforts to integrate vegetation and hydrology processes have paid dividends. The most complex models that resolve three-dimensional interactions between buildings in general did not perform as well as other categories. However, these models also tended to have the simplest representations of hydrology and vegetation. Models without any urban representation (i.e. vegetation-only land surface models) performed poorly for latent heat fluxes, and reasonably for other energy fluxes at this suburban site. Our analysis identified widespread human errors in initial submissions that substantially affected model performances. Although significant efforts are applied to correct these errors, we conclude that human factors are likely to influence results in this (or any) model intercomparison, particularly where participating scientists have varying experience and first languages. These initial results are for one suburban site, and future phases of Urban-PLUMBER will evaluate models across twenty sites in different urban and regional climate zones.</p><hr>'
Naserikia2023LandSurfaceAirTemperature='<p>Due to the scarcity of air temperature (Ta) observations, urban heat studies often rely on satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) to characterise the near-surface thermal environment. However, there remains a lack of a quantitative understanding on how LST differs from Ta within urban areas and what are the controlling factors of their interaction. We use crowdsourced air temperature measurements in Sydney, Australia, combined with urban landscape data, Local Climate Zones (LCZ), high-resolution satellite imagery, and machine learning to explore the interplay of urban form and fabric on the interaction between Ta and LST. Results show that LST and Ta have distinct lspatiotemporal characteristics, and their relationship differs by season, ecological infrastructure, and building morphology. We found greater seasonal variability in LST compared to Ta, along with more pronounced intra-urban spatial variability in LST, particularly in warmer seasons. We also observed a greater temperature difference between LST and Ta in the built environment compared to the natural LCZs, especially during warm days. Natural LCZs (areas with mostly dense and scattered trees) showed stronger LST-Ta relationships compared to built areas. In particular, we observe that built areas with higher building density (where the heat vulnerability is likely more pronounced) show insignificant or negative relationships between LST-Ta in summer. Our results also indicate that surface cover, distance from the ocean, and seasonality significantly influence the distribution of hot and cold spots for LST and Ta. The spatial distribution for Ta hot spots does not always overlap with LST. We find that relying solely on LST as a direct proxy for the urban thermal environment is inappropriate, particularly in densely built-up areas and during warm seasons. These findings provide new perspectives on the relationship between surface and canopy temperatures and how these relate to urban form and fabric.</p><hr>'
Wanyan2023_Dicta_Footpaths='<p>Footpath mapping, modeling, and analysis can provide important geospatial insights to many fields of study, including transport, health, environment and urban planning.  The availability of robust Geographic Information System (GIS) layers can benefit the management of infrastructure inventories, especially at local government level with urban planners responsible for the deployment and maintenance of such infrastructure. However, many cities still lack real-time information on the location, connectivity, and width of footpaths, and/or employ costly and manual survey means to gather this information. This work designs and implements an automatic pipeline for generating footpath networks based on remote sensing images using machine learning models. The annotation of segmentation tasks, especially labeling remote sensing images with specialized requirements, is very expensive, so we aim to introduce a pipeline requiring less labeled data. Considering supervised methods require large amounts of training data, we use a self-supervised method for feature representation learning to reduce annotation requirements. Then the pre-trained model is used as the encoder of the U-Net for footpath segmentation. Based on the generated masks, the footpath polygons are extracted and converted to footpath networks which can be loaded and visualized by geographic information systems conveniently. Validation results indicate considerable consistency when compared to manually collected GIS layers. The footpath network generation pipeline proposed in this work is low-cost and extensible, and it can be applied where remote sensing images are available.

Xu2023LeveragingSAM='<p>Segment-Anything model (SAM) is a foundation segmentation model published in April 2023. Trained on an unprecedented 11 million annotated images, the model can generate segmented masks bearing clear-cut contours by integrating user-provided prompts. It is zero-shot transferable, requiring no task-specific training. Nevertheless, its applicability for geographic vision tasks has not been fully evaluated. There is no automated prompt-feeding method incorporating with SAM that can work efficiently for purposeful batch processing as well. To fill these gaps, we developed a process that can be executed automatically from visual-prompts extraction to road width measurement, utilizing OpenStreetMap (OSM) and SAM. By examining the quality of segmentation in various image contexts, we evaluated the capacity and limitations of SAM working on aerial imagery. Through comparing measured widths to VicRoads records, we validated the specially designed width-measuring algorithm for high precision and accuracy. After this process, prompt-indicated zero-shot approach in solving basic geographic vision tasks is to be shaped synchronously on both theory and application ends.</p><hr>'
CHEUNG153R1='<p>Private backyards are an important space for social and physical activities. Summer heat stress can reduce people’s willingness to use their backyards. Long-term turf irrigation has been demonstrated to reduce daytime mean air temperature because it can maintain soil moisture content at or near field capacity for a longer period, thereby increasing evaporation from soil surface and turf transpiration. This cooling effect is likely to be stronger during and immediately after irrigation because of direct evaporation as the sprayed water streams pass through the air and from water intercepted by the turf grass canopy. This study aims to measure the magnitude and duration of this instantaneous cooling effect from turf irrigation. The field experiment consisted of two 6m × 6m plots (one irrigated and one unirrigated) fenced to mimic a backyard environment. Daily irrigation of 2 mm was applied at 13:00 local time. The experiment was conducted in summer 2021 in Melbourne, Australia and lasted for six weeks. The instantaneous cooling effect from irrigation lasted for approximately two hours (13:00–15:59, instantaneous cooling) before the air temperature and turf surface temperature returned to the levels measured before irrigation (10:00–12:59, baseline cooling). The instantaneous cooling effect for air temperature and turf surface temperature were –0.54°C and –1.01°C, respectively. The results suggest that the daytime cooling effect of irrigation may be strengthened by applying smaller amounts at multiple times throughout the warmest part of the day, thereby increasing the direction evaporation of water during and after irrigation.</p><hr>'
Bhowmick2022SystematicScopingBicycleVolumes='<p>Estimation of bicycling volumes is essential for the strategic implementation of infrastructure and related transport elements and policies. Link-level volume estimation models (models that estimate volumes on individual street segments) allow for understanding variation in bicycling volumes across an entire network at higher spatial resolution than area-level models. Such models assist transport planners to efficiently monitor network usage, to identify opportunities to enhance safety and to evaluate the impact of policy and infrastructure interventions. However, given the sparsity and scarcity of bicycling data as compared to its motorised counterparts, link-level bicycling volume estimation literature is relatively limited. This paper conducts a scoping review of link-level bicycling volume estimation methods by implementing systematic search strategies across relevant databases, thereby identifying appropriate studies for the review. The review resulted in some interesting findings. Among all the methods implemented, direct demand modelling was the predominant one. Not a single study implemented multiple modelling approaches in the same study area, thereby not allowing for comparison of these approaches. Most studies were conducted in the United States. It was also observed that there exists a lot of heterogeneity in the reporting of basic study characteristics and validation results, sometimes to the extent of not reporting these at all. The study presents the different types of data used in modelling (count, travel survey, GPS data) along with an array of popular explanatory variables that can inform future studies about data collection and variable selection for modelling. The study discusses the strengths and limitations of different methods and finally presents recommendations for future research.</p><hr>'
Cheung2022DaytimeIrrigation='<p> Backyards play important roles for individual households because they provide a private and safe green space for social and environmental interactions, relaxation, gardening and children’s ac­tivities. The use of backyards is highly dependent on their thermal conditions. Turf is a common surface type in backyards but unirrigated turf can be as warm  as pavement, bringing thermal discomfort and discouraging people from using them. Under certain conditions, turf irrigation provides an opportunity to reduce thermal stress by increasing evapotranspiration. This study aims to measure the impacts of turf irrigation on microclimate in a backyard environment in the warm season in Melbourne, Australia. The experiment consisted of four 6m × 6m turf-covered plots. Daily irrigation was applied at four amounts: 0, 2, 4 and 7mm for six weeks. In Week 6, the 4-mm irrigation reduced daytime soil temperature, turf surface temperature, air temperature and universal thermal climate index by 1.7, 2.3, 0.6 and 0.4◦C, respectively. All daytime impacts were significant (p<0.05, t-test). Irrigation has the potential to significantly improve the thermal conditions of backyards in combination with the use of tree shade.</p><hr>'
Nice2022UrbanFormAndFabric='<p> Public health risks resulting from urban heat in cities are increasing due to rapid urbanisation and climate change, motivating closer attention to urban heat mitigation and adaptation strategies that enable climate-sensitive urban design and development. These strategies incorporate four key factors influencing heat stress in cities: the urban form (morphology of vegetated and built surfaces), urban fabric, urban function (including human activities), and background climate and regional geographic settings (e.g. topography and distance to water bodies). The first two factors can be modified and redesigned as urban heat mitigation strategies (e.g. changing the albedo of surfaces, replacing hard surfaces with pervious vegetated surfaces, or increasing canopy cover). Regional geographical settings of cities, on the other hand, cannot be modified and while human activities can be modified, it often requires holistic behavioural and policy modifications and the impacts of these can be difficult to quantify. When evaluating the effectiveness of urban heat mitigation strategies in observational or traditional modelling studies, it can be difficult to separate the impacts of modifications to the built and natural forms from the interactions of the geographic influences, limiting the universality of results. To address this, we introduce a new methodology to determine the influence of urban form and fabric on thermal comfort, by utilising a comprehensive combination of possible urban forms, an urban morphology data source, and micro-climate modelling. We perform 9814 simulations covering a wide range of realistic built and natural forms (building, roads, grass, and tree densities as well as building and tree heights) to determine their importance and influence on thermal environments in urban canyons without geographical influences. We show that higher daytime air temperatures and thermal comfort indices are strongly driven by increased street fractions, with maximum air temperatures increases of up to 10 and 15◦C as street fractions increase from 10% (very narrow street canyons and/or extensive vegetation cover) to 80 and 90% (wide street canyons). Up to 5◦C reductions in daytime air temperatures are seen with increasing grass and tree fractions from zero (fully urban) to complete (fully natural) coverage. Similar patterns are seen with the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), with increasing street fractions of 80% and 90% driving increases of 6 and 12◦C, respectively. We then apply the results at a city-wide scale, generating heat maps of several Australian cities showing the impacts of present day urban form and fabric. The resulting method allows mitigation strategies to be tested on modifiable urban form factors isolated from geography, topography, and local weather conditions, factors that cannot easily be modified.</p><hr>'
Lipson2022CityDescriptiveInputData='<p> In urban climate studies, datasets used to describe urban characteristics have traditionally taken a class-based approach, whereby urban areas are classified into a limited number of typologies with a resulting loss of fidelity. New datasets are becoming increasingly available that describe the three-dimensional structure of cities at sub-metre micro-scale resolutions, resolving individual buildings and trees across entire continents. These datasets can be used to accurately determine local characteristics without relying on classes, but their direct use in numerical weather and climate modelling has been limited by their availability, and because they require processing to conform to the required inputs of climate models. Here, we process building-resolving datasets across large geographical extents to derive city-descriptive parameters suitable as common model inputs at resolutions more appropriate for local or meso-scale modelling. These parameter values are then compared with the ranges obtained through the class-based Local Climate Zone framework. Results are presented for two case studies, Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, as open access data tables for integration into urban climate models, as well as codes for processing high-resolution and three-dimensional urban datasets. We also provide an open access 300 m resolution building morphology and surface cover dataset for the Sydney metropolitan region (approximately 5,000 square kilometres). The use of building resolving data to derive model inputs at the grid scale better captures the distinct heterogenetic characteristics of urban form and fabric compared with class-based approaches, leading to a more accurate representation of cities in climate models. As consistent building-resolving datasets become available over larger geographical extents, we expect bottom-up approaches to replace top-down class-based frameworks.</p><hr>'

Cheung2022IrrigatingUrbanGreenspace='<p> Evapotranspiration is an important cooling mechanism in urban green space (UGS). Irrigating vegetated surfaces with potable water, collected stormwater or recycled sewage water has the potential to increase the cooling effect of UGS by increasing evapotranspiration. Such cooling effect may not always be strong because evapotranspiration is dependent on local and regional factors such as background climate, seasonality and vegetation type. When using irrigation for cooling, city managers also need to consider management issues such as irrigation water supply and amenity use of the UGS. This study aims to develop a theoretical framework that explains the physical and energetic mechanisms of irrigation cooling effect and a framework to assist city managers to make decision about the use of irrigation for urban cooling. This is achieved by reviewing the impacts of irrigation on local climate reported in the literature and identifying the regional and local factors that influence irrigation cooling effect in warm seasons. The literature suggests that irrigation can potentially reduce daily maximum air temperature and ground surface temperature by approximately 2.5◦C and 4.9◦C, respectively, depending on weather conditions and irrigation amount. Background climate is an important factor that influences the cooling potentials of irrigation. Cities with dry and warm climates have the highest cooling potentials from irrigation. The cooling potentials are also influenced by seasonality and weather, vegetation type, irrigation time of day and irrigation amount. Cities with a dry and warm season can consider using irrigation to mitigate urban heat within UGS because such climatic conditions can increase cooling potentials. To maximise irrigation cooling effect, cities with abundant irrigation water supply can use a soil moisture-controlled irrigation regime while those with limited supply can use a temperature-controlled regime. More studies are required to understand the cooling potentials of irrigating small, individual UGS. </p><hr>'
Wijnands2022ImpactCOVID19AirPollution='<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries implemented public health ordinances that resulted in restricted mobility and a resultant change in air quality. This has provided an opportunity to quantify the extent to which carbon-based transport and industrial activity affect air quality. However, quantification of these complex effects has proven to be difficult, depending on the stringency of restrictions, country-specific emission source profiles, long-term trends and meteorological effects on atmospheric chemistry, emission levels and in-flow from nearby countries. In this study, confounding factors were disentangled for a direct comparison of pandemic-related reductions in absolute pollutions levels, globally. The non-linear relationships between atmospheric processes and daily ground-level NO2 , PM10 , PM2.5 and O3 measurements were captured in city- and pollutant-specific XGBoost models for over 700 cities, adjusting for weather, seasonality and trends. City-level modelling allowed adaptation to the distinct topography, urban morphology, climate and atmospheric conditions for each city, individually, as the weather variables that were most predictive varied across cities. Pollution forecasts for 2020 in absence of a pandemic were generated based on weather and formed an ensemble for country-level pollution reductions. Findings were robust to modelling assumptions and consistent with various published case studies. NO2 reduced most in China, Europe and India, following severe government restrictions as part of the initial lockdowns. Reductions were highly correlated with changes in mobility levels, especially trips to transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation venues. Further, NO2 did not fully revert to pre-pandemic levels in 2020. Ambient PM2.5 pollution, which has severe adverse health consequences, reduced most in China and India. Since positive health effects could be offset to some extent by prolonged exposure to indoor pollution, alternative transport initiatives could prove to be an important pathway towards better health outcomes in these countries. Increased O3 levels during initial lockdowns have been documented widely. However, our analyses also found a subsequent reduction in O3 for many countries below what was expected based on meteorological conditions during summer months (e.g., China, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Turkey). The effects in periods with high O3 levels are especially important for the development of effective mitigation strategies to improve health outcomes.</p><hr>'
Beck2022DevelopingUrbanBikingTypologies='<p> Extensive research has been conducted exploring associations between built environment characteristics and biking. However, these approaches have often lacked the ability to understand the interactions of the built environment, population and bicycle ridership. To overcome these limitations, this study aimed to develop novel urban biking typologies using unsupervised machine learning methods. We conducted a retrospective analysis of travel surveys, bicycle infrastructure and population and land use characteristics in the Greater Melbourne region, Australia. To develop the urban biking typology, we used a k-medoids clustering method. Analyses revealed 5 clusters. We highlight areas with high bicycle network density and a high proportion of trips made by bike (Cluster 1; reflecting 12% of the population of Greater Melbourne, but 57% of all bike trips) and areas with high off-road and on-road bicycle network length, but a low proportion of trips made by bike (Cluster 4, reflecting 23% of the population of Greater Melbourne and 13% of all bike trips). Our novel approach to developing an urban biking typology enabled the exploration of the interaction of bicycle ridership, the bicycle network, population and land use characteristics. Such approaches are important in advancing our understanding of bicycling behaviour, but further research is required to understand the generalisability of these findings to other settings.</p><hr>'

In Victoria’s second wave, we estimated in early September 2020 that a rolling 14-day average of <5 new cases per day was achievable on or around 26 October.

However, the performance of such methods on remote sensing imagery domains remains under-explored. In this work, we explore contrastive representation learning methods on the task of imagery-based city classification, an important problem in urban computing. We use satellite and map imagery across 2 domains, 3 million locations and more than 1500 cities. We show that self-supervised methods can build a generalizable representation from as few as 200 cities, with representations achieving over 95% accuracy in unseen cities with minimal additional training. We also find that the performance discrepancy of such methods, when compared to supervised methods, induced by the domain discrepancy between natural imagery and abstract imagery is significant for remote sensing imagery. We compare all analysis against existing supervised models from academic literature and open-source our models for broader usage and further criticism.</p><hr>'
Cheung2021CoolingPotentialIrrigating='<p>Modern agricultural irrigation can produce extensive cooling that is strong enough to mask the current effect of global climate change. Irrigating urban green spaces therefore has the potential to mitigate heat stress in cities. However, the cooling potentials of irrigating urban green space in different climate regions of the world have never been estimated. Here we conducted a systematic literature review to determine air temperature reductions in past experimental, observational and modelling studies (N = 17). We developed an empirical model with the irrigation cooling effect as the dependent variable and background air temperature and rainfall of the study area as the independent variables. The model was subsequently used to estimate the cooling potential of irrigating green spaces in 100 global cities with arid, temperate and continental climates. We predict that 91 of the 100 cities will receive a cooling benefit from irrigating urban green space (mean = −1.09◦C), whereas the remaining nine cities will experience a slight warming effect (mean = +0.76◦C). The cooling potential of irrigating urban green space is greatest in arid cities (mean = − 1.65◦C).</p><hr>'

A deep autoencoder extracted high-level features, including the intersection’s type, size, shape, lane markings, and complexity, which were used to cluster similar designs. An Australian telematics data set linked infrastructure design to driving behaviors captured during 66 million kilometers of driving. This showed more frequent hard acceleration events (per vehicle) at four- than three-way intersections, relatively low hard deceleration frequencies at T-intersections, and consistently low average speeds on roundabouts. Overall, domain-specific feature extraction enabled the identification of infrastructure improvements that could result in safer driving behaviors, potentially reducing road trauma.</p><hr>'
Nice2020ParisEnd='<p>Urban typologies allow areas to be categorised according to form and the social, demographic, and political uses of the areas. The use of these typologies and finding similarities and dissimilarities between cities enables better targeted interventions for improved health, transport, and environmental outcomes in urban areas. A better understanding of local contexts can also assist in applying lessons learned from other cities. Constructing urban typologies at a global scale through traditional methods, such as functional or network analysis, requires the collection of data across multiple political districts, which can be inconsistent and then require a level of subjective classification. To overcome these limitations, we use neural networks to analyse millions of images of urban form (consisting of street view, satellite imagery, and street maps) to find shared characteristics between the largest 1692 cities in the world. The comparison city of Paris is used as an exemplar and we perform a case study using two Australian cities, Melbourne and Sydney, to determine if a “Paris-end” of town exists or can be found in these cities using these three big data imagery sets. The results show specific advantages and disadvantages of each type of imagery in constructing urban typologies. Neural networks trained with map imagery will be highly influenced by the structural mix of roads, public transport, and green and blue space. Satellite imagery captures a combination of both urban form and decorative and natural details. The use of street view imagery emphasises the features of a human-scaled visual geography of streetscapes. However, for both satellite and street view imagery to be highly effective, a reduction in scale and more aggressive pre-processing might be required in order to reduce detail and create greater abstraction in the imagery.</p><hr>'
Thompson2020GlobalAnalysisUrbanDesignTypes='<p>Background Death and injury due to motor vehicle crashes is the world’s fifth leading cause of mortality and morbidity. City and urban designs might play a role in mitigating the global burden of road transport injury to an extent that has not been captured by traditional safe system approaches. We aimed to determine the relationship between urban design and road trauma across the globe.</p><p>Methods Applying a combined convolutional neural network and graph-based approach, 1692 cities capturing one third of the world’s population were classified into types based on urban design characteristics represented in sample maps. Associations between identified city types, characteristics contained within sample maps, and the burden of road transport injury as measured by disability adjusted life-years were estimated through univariate and multivariate analyses, controlling for the influence of economic activity.</p><p>Findings Between Mar 1, 2017, and Dec 24, 2018, nine global city types based on a final sample of 1632 cities were identified. Burden of road transport injury was an estimated two-times higher (risk ratio 2·05, 95% CI 1·84–2·27) for the poorest performing city type compared with the best performing city type, culminating in an estimated loss of 8·71 (8·08–9·25) million disability-adjusted life-years per year attributable to suboptimal urban design. City types that featured a greater proportion of railed public transport networks combined with dense road networks characterised by smaller blocks showed the lowest rates of road traffic injury.</p><p>Interpretation This study highlights the important role that city and urban design plays in mitigating road transport injury burden at a global scale. It is recommended that road and transport safety efforts promote urban design that features characteristics inherent in identified high-performance city types including higher density road infrastructure and high rates of public transit.</p><hr>'
Meili2020UTC='<p> Increasing urbanization is likely to intensify the urban heat island effect, decrease outdoor thermal comfort, and enhance runoff generation in cities. Urban green spaces are often proposed as a mitigation strategy to counteract these adverse effects, and many recent developments of urban climate models focus on the inclusion of green and blue infrastructure to inform urban planning. However, many models still lack the ability to account for different plant types and oversimplify the interactions between the built environment, vegetation, and hydrology. In this study, we present an urban ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C), that combines principles of ecosystem modelling with an urban canopy scheme accounting for the biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics of roof vegetation, ground vegetation, and urban trees. UT&C is a fully coupled energy and water balance model that calculates 2 m air temperature, 2m humidity, and surface temperatures based on the infinite urban canyon approach. It further calculates the urban hydrological fluxes in the absence of snow, including transpiration as a function of plant photosynthesis. Hence, UT&C accounts for the effects of different plant types on the urban climate and hydrology, as well as the effects of the urban environment on plant well-being and performance. UT&C performs well when compared against energy flux measurements of eddy-covariance towers located in three cities in different climates (Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix). A sensitivity analysis, performed as a proof of concept for the city of Singapore, shows a mean decrease in 2m air temperature of 1.1C for fully grass-covered ground, 0.2C for high values of leaf area index (LAI), and 0.3◦C for high values of Vc,max (an expression of photosynthetic capacity). These reductions in temperature were combined with a simultaneous increase in relative humidity by 6.5%, 2.1%, and 1.6%, for fully grass-covered ground, high values of LAI, and high values of Vc,max , respectively. Furthermore, the increase of pervious vegetated ground is able to significantly reduce surface runoff.</p><hr>'
Gal2020MeanRadiantTemperatureOutdoors='<p> The thermal environment of cities is deteriorating steadily owing to both urbanization and climate change. As a consequence, urban planners and city officials are increasingly under pressure to maintain livable urban environments. In this respect, numerical models offer the quickest and most economic means to assessing the performance and viability of various urban heat mitigation strategies. Owing to these advantages, the numerical approach gained popularity over the past decade—as indicated by the profusion of such studies and the proliferation of microclimate models. </p><hr>'
Todorovic2020ModelsForWaterSensitiveInfill='<p>Infill development in Australian cities over the coming decades is expected to have considerable negative influence on the hydrology, resource efficiency, liveability and amenity of our cities. This project aims to develop and apply a performance evaluation framework to understand infill impacts, create design options and processes for improved outcomes through case studies, and identify improved governance options and arrangements. A `typologies catalogue` of spatial configurations and architectural models relevant to high amenity medium density infill development has been prepared, with different arrangements and combinations of buildings and open spaces applied on a case study development site in Adelaide, SA. Design scenarios from the catalogue are evaluated against a range of qualitative and quantitative performative criteria, developed in consultation with industry partners, including water and urban heat performance assessment. The case study site designs offer practical models and methods for achieving infill development and densification in a manner that improves amenity within the dwelling, across the site and for the surrounding precinct – while maintaining or improving water and urban heat performance. During this process, a set of key design principles for water sensitive infill development is defined, with prospects to further inform infill development practice and related policies. </p><hr>'
Nice2019SkyPixels='<p> Computer vision techniques enable automated detection of sky pixels in outdoor imagery. In urban climate, sky detection is an important first step in gathering information about urban morphology and sky view factors. However, obtaining accurate results remains challenging and becomes even more complex using imagery captured under a variety of lighting and weather conditions.</p><p>To address this problem, we present a new sky pixel detection system demonstrated to produce accurate results using a wide range of outdoor imagery types. Images are processed using a selection of mean-shift segmentation, K-means clustering, and Sobel filters to mark sky pixels in the scene. The algorithm for a specific image is chosen by a convolutional neural network, trained with 25,000 images from the Skyfinder data set, reaching 82% accuracy for the top three classes. This selection step allows the sky marking to follow an adaptive process and to use different techniques and parameters to best suit a particular image. An evaluation of fourteen different techniques and parameter sets shows that no single technique can perform with high accuracy across varied Skyfinder and Google Street View data sets. However, by using our adaptive process, large increases in accuracy are observed. The resulting system is shown to perform better than other published techniques. </p><hr>'
Stevenson2019RoadTrafficInjury='<p> Over the past four decades considerable efforts have been taken to mitigate the growing burden of road injury. With increasing urbanisation along with global mobility that demands not only safe but equitable, efficient and clean (reduced carbon footprint) transport, the responses to dealing with the burgeoning road traffic injury in low- and middle-income countries has become increasingly complex. In this paper, we apply unique methods to identify important strategies that could be implemented to reduce road traffic injury in the Asia-Pacific region; a region comprising large middle-income countries (China and India) that are currently in the throes of rapid motorisation. Using a convolutional neural network approach, we clustered countries containing a total of 1632 cities from around the world into groups based on urban characteristics related to road and public transport infrastructure. We then analysed 20 countries (containing 689 cities) from the Asia-Pacific region and assessed the global burden of disease attributed to road traffic injury and these various urban characteristics. This study demonstrates the utility of employing image  recognition methods to discover new insights that afford urban and transport planning opportunities to mitigate road traffic injury at a regional and global scale.</p><hr>'
Wijnands2019DriverDrowsiness='<p> Driver drowsiness increases crash risk, leading to substantial road trauma each year. Drowsiness detection methods have received considerable attention, but few studies have investigated the implementation of a detection approach on a mobile phone. Phone applications reduce the need for specialised hardware and hence, enable a cost-effective roll-out of the technology across the driving population. While it has been shown that three-dimensional (3D) operations are more suitable for spatiotemporal feature learning, current methods for drowsiness detection commonly use frame-based, multi-step approaches. However, computationally expensive techniques that achieve superior results on action recognition benchmarks (e.g. 3D convolutions, optical flow extraction) create bottlenecks for real-time, safety-critical applications on mobile devices. Here, we show how depthwise separable 3D convolutions, combined with an early fusion of spatial and temporal information, can achieve a balance between high prediction accuracy and real-time inference requirements. In particular, increased accuracy is achieved when assessment requires motion information, for example, when sunglasses conceal the eyes. Further, a custom TensorFlow-based smartphone application shows the true impact of various approaches on inference times and demonstrates the effectiveness of real-time monitoring based on out-of-sample data to alert a drowsy driver. Our model is pre-trained on ImageNet and Kinetics and fine-tuned on a publicly available Driver Drowsiness Detection dataset. Fine-tuning on large naturalistic driving datasets could further improve accuracy to obtain robust in-vehicle performance. Overall, our research is a step towards practical deep learning applications, potentially preventing micro-sleeps and reducing road trauma.</p><hr>'
Zhao2019ReducingCyclistCrashes='<p> Background: Cycling is an active and sustainable transportation mode, and is associated with health, environmental and societal benefits. Therefore, increasing the use of bicycles is being supported as a transport policy in many countries. However, despite these benefits, cyclists are vulnerable road users and are over-represented in traffic crash casualties compared to other modes of transport. The injury concern can discourage people from adopting cycling as a main transportation mode. Urban infrastructure that caters to cyclists` safety can potentially reduce crashes and therefore, injury morbidity and mortality.</p><p> Methods: This research uses cyclist crashes recorded by the state road authority from 2010 to 2013 in Greater Melbourne. Exposure data used anonymised bicycle trips recorded by volunteer users of RiderLog smartphone application from 2010 to 2013. Crash locations and control sites were sampled from areas with high cycling exposure. Google Street View maps and satellite images at crash locations and control sites were downloaded to capture information of the road environments where cyclists crash and never crash. Deep learning methods using generative adversarial networks were applied to explore features of road environments associated with cyclist crashes.</p><p> Results: A number of unique observations were identified namely, that locations that have low crash risk had more green space (trees or grass), and median strips (that separate traffic from opposing lanes on divided roadways) also decreased a cyclist’s crash risk. Road environments with high-rise buildings casting shadows on the roadside are mostly seen in the environment in which crashes occurred. The experiments also identified factors that have been reported previously in the literature and statistical analysis, providing confidence in the presented methods. Such factors include tram tracks, intersections, on-road parking and off-road bicycle paths. Statistical analysis showed 52.6% of crash locations were within 5 metres of a tram line, while this percentage for control sites was 5.6%.</p><p> Conclusions: This research presents a method that takes advantage of the increasing availability of big datasets, computing power and the advances of deep learning techniques, to analyse the road environments of locations where cyclists crash from a new perspective. The findings give urban planners insights on how streetscapes might be reconstructed to improve safety situations for cyclists. The results also provide transportation engineers and cyclists with visual indications about what kind of streetscapes are safer.</p><hr>'
Aschwanden2019LearningTowalk='<p> Transportation mode distribution has a large implication on the resilience, economic output, social cost of cities and the health of urban residents. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and the availability of remote sensing data have opened up opportunities for bottom-up modeling techniques that allow understanding of how subtle differences in the urban fabric can impact transportation mode share distribution. This project presents a novel neural network-based modeling technique capable of predicting transportation mode distribution. Trained with millions of images labeled with information from a georeferenced transportation survey, the resulting model is able to infer transportation mode share with high accuracy (R2 1⁄4 0.58) from satellite images alone. Additionally, this method can disaggregate data in areas where only aggregated information is available and infer transportation mode share in areas without underlying information. This work demonstrates a new and objective method to evaluate the impact of the urban fabric on transportation mode share. The methodology is robust and can be adapted for cases around the world as well as deployed to evaluate the impact of new developments on the transportation mode choice.</p><hr>'
Wijnands2019StreetscapeAugmentation='<p>Deep learning using neural networks has provided advances in image style transfer, merging the content of one image (e.g., a photo) with the style of another (e.g., a painting). Our research shows this concept can be extended to analyse the design of streetscapes in relation to health and wellbeing outcomes. An Australian population health survey (n = 34,000) was used to identify the spatial distribution of health and wellbeing outcomes, including general health and social capital. For each outcome, the most and least desirable locations formed two domains. Streetscape design was sampled using around 80,000 Google Street View images per domain. Generative adversarial networks translated these images from one domain to the other, preserving the main structure of the input image, but transforming the ‘style’ from locations where self-reported health was bad to locations where it was good. These translations indicate that areas in Melbourne with good general health are characterised by sufficient green space and compactness of the urban environment, whilst streetscape imagery related to high social capital contained more and wider footpaths, fewer fences and more grass. Beyond identifying relationships, the method is a first step towards computer-generated design interventions that have the potential to improve population health and wellbeing. </p><hr>'
Dommenget2019MSCMDB='<p> This study introduces the Monash Simple Climate Model (MSCM) experiment database. The simulations are based on the Globally Resolved Energy Balance (GREB) model to study three different aspects of climate model simulations: (1) understanding processes that control the mean climate, (2) the response of the climate to a doubling of the CO2 concentration, and (3) scenarios of external forcing (CO2 concentration and solar radiation). A series of sensitivity experiments in which elements of the climate system are turned off in various combinations are used to address (1) and (2). This database currently provides more than 1300 experiments and has an online web interface for fast analysis and free access to the data. We briefly outline the design of all experiments, give a discussion of some results, put the findings into the context of previously published results from similar experiments, discuss the quality and limitations of the MSCM experiments, and also give an outlook on possible further developments. The GREB model simulation is quite realistic, but the model without flux corrections has a root mean square error in the mean state of the surface temperature of about 10 ◦C, which is larger than those of general circulation models (2◦C). It needs to be noted here that the GREB model does not simulate circulation changes or changes in cloud cover (feedbacks). However, the MSCM experiments show good agreement to previously published studies. Although GREB is a very simple model, it delivers good first-order estimates, is very fast, highly accessible, and can be used to quickly try many different sensitivity experiments or scenarios. It builds a basis on which conceptual ideas can be tested to first order and it provides a null hypothesis for understanding complex climate interactions in the context of response to external forcing or interactions in the climate subsystems.</p><hr>'
Broadbent2019TARGET='<p> The adverse impacts of urban heat and global climate change are leading policymakers to consider green and blue infrastructure (GBI) for heat mitigation benefits. Though many models exist to evaluate the cooling impacts of GBI, their complexity and computational demand leaves most of them largely inaccessible to those without specialist expertise and computing facilities. Here a new model called The Air-temperature Response to Green/blue-infrastructure Evaluation Tool (TARGET) is presented. TARGET is designed to be efficient and easy to use, with fewer user-defined parameters and less model input data required than other urban climate models. TARGET can be used to model average street-level air temperature at canyon-to-block scales (e.g. 100 m resolution), meaning it can be used to assess temperature impacts of suburb-to-city-scale GBI proposals. The model aims to balance realistic representation of physical processes and computation efficiency. An evaluation against two different datasets shows that TARGET can reproduce the magnitude and patterns of both air temperature and surface temperature within suburban environments. To demonstrate the utility of the model for planners and policymakers, the results from two precinct-scale heat mitigation scenarios are presented. TARGET is available to the public, and ongoing development, including a graphical user interface, is planned for future work.</p><hr>'
Nice2018DevelopmentVTUF3D='<p>With urban areas facing longer duration heat-waves and temperature extremes from climate change and growing urban development, adaptation strategies are needed to protect city residents. Examining the role that increased tree cover and water availability can have on human thermal comfort (HTC) is needed to help guide the development of thermally comfortable cities. To inform planning, modelling tools are needed that provide sufficient resolution to resolve urban influences on HTC and the ability to model important physiological processes of vegetation. To achieve this, a new micro-scale model, VTUF-3D (Vegetated Temperatures of Urban Facets) has been developed. In it, offline modelling of individual items of vegetation is performed using the MAESPA process-based tree model (Duursma and Medlyn, 2012) (a model that can model individual trees, vegetation, and soil components), and integrated into the TUF-3D (Krayenhoff and Voogt, 2007) urban micro-climate surface energy balance (SEB) model. This innovative approach allows the new model to account for important vegetative physiological processes and shading effects, using configurable templates to allow representation of any type of vegetation or water sensitive design feature. This work enables detailed calculations of surface temperatures (Tsfc), mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), and a HTC index, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI), across urban canyons. This study presents an overview of VTUF-3D. Also presented are two evaluations of VTUF-3D. The first evaluation compares modelled surface energy balance fluxes to observations in Preston, Australia (Coutts et al., 2007). The second evaluation compares spatial and temporal predictions of Tmrt and UTCI to two observed street canyons in the City of Melbourne (Coutts et al., 2015b). The VTUF-3D model is shown to perform well and is suitable for use to examine critical questions relating to the role of vegetation and water in the urban environment in support of HTC.</p><hr>'
