I did 365papers a few years ago. Lots of work but ultimately quite rewarding reading and writing about 365 papers over a year. So, I'll try again this year starting with this very recent paper. 
1/ #365papers 
In which a new module for the PUCM urban canopy model is developed, PUCM-mist, to model the impacts of misters. Modelling is performed for Phoenix and Houston (dry and humid climates), finding a flow rate of 0.1L/min can induce reductions in maximum canyon air temperature of 17.5C. Cooling is also seen in Houston, but about half that amount. Optimal cooling under intermediate wind speeds. Rapid cooling can be induced through the combination of misting and pavement sprinkling. Trying to wrap my head around the 17.5C, which is huge, but using lots of water and saturating the air, and altering both the potential maximum temperature and the time of day the maximum is reached.

In which the author (who is the founder of Sci-Hub) discusses different types of open access for scientific publications (and color codes), ranging from Sci-Hub (red), open access - PloS, MDPI, Frontiers (yellow/gold), preprints - arXiv (green), academic social networks - ResearchGate (blue). New categories beyond the green and gold ones established after the Budapest Open Access Initiative.

In which proposed policies (mass deportations, tariffs, reduced independence of the Federal Reserve) of a second Trump presidency are evaluated for their potential impacts on the US and global economy. Combined scenarios of high impact (60% tariffs with trading partner retaliations, 8 million deportations, no Reserve independence) could cause a 10% reduction in GDP and 7% inflation while lower impact (60% tariffs without retaliations, 1 million deportations, Reserve independence erosion) will still account for 3% reduction in GDP and 4% inflation.

In which the impacts of tree planting projects for biomass storage at high northern latitudes are examined. The disturbances caused by albedo changes and the disruption of soil carbon storage will cause net warming and negative effects on Arctic biota and livelihoods. Tree planting can be great but the Arctic probably isn't the right place for it.

In which, using wet-bulb temperature (accounting for humid heat) data across Mexico, high heat kills disproportionately more young people (especially under 5) than elderly (who more more vulnerable to cold). Children have higher body surface area, less developed immune systems, and less independence to express their discomfort. And young adults have higher exposure to high heat situations and less resources to adapt. Further, climate change is expected to drive increased disproportionate impacts.

In which many questions and assumptions about urban scaling theory are addressed. Urban scaling started as identifying nonlinear relationships of urban growth relative to population. Contrasts are made between scaling and Zipf's and Gravity laws. How different definitions of cities effect them. Do they apply to past settlements? Interactions between cities. And the place of urban scaling in general urban science.

In which the author examines (in 1955) how earthworms react to different water conditions (dry vs full immersion). Sort of trying to find why worms are found on pavement after rain. They show some resistance to desiccation.  
Some worms are found to be able to survive underwater for days or even weeks. Given a choice, some species seek air-filled soil while some go for water-filled soil.

7/ #365papers 

In which, in more recent earthworm research, some species show poor tolerance to water immersion and generally use more oxygen at night. Other species can survive longer underwater and have lower oxygen consumption and without a diurnal rhythm. So, why worms emerge from rain soaked soil at night might depend on which species and different oxygen needs.

In which the rates of divorce (termination of a pair bond) of the Seychelles warbler are examined as influenced by weather. Findings are that increased divorces are preceded by years of low and high rainfall. It remains unclear whether this is adaptive, maladaptive, or neutral. Or can these behaviour changes help adapt to a changing climate?

In which the increase in emissions to add AI generated answers (GPT-3) to Google search results is quantified. In 2009, Google search used about 0.0003 kWh per search (0.2g of CO2). Increased efficiency probably means current searches use 0.000004 kWh. Adding AI probably brings this up to 0.002 kWh, or about 100 times more. Additionally, while training AI is resource intensive, the subsequent usage of ChatGPT dominates emissions.

10/ #365papers 

In which the openness of OpenAI (and AI in general) is examined. Findings are that most modern AI is dependent on and controlled by a few large corporations. Openness mostly fails in the categories of transparency, reusability, and extensibility. Underlying hidden problem of colonialism - labor exploitation and cultural data sovereignty. Necessary computational resources close general access. AI might have a similar story to corporate dominance moves in open-source software, but some differences exist.

In which the potential for the Kessler Syndrome (runaway debris growth in Earth's orbit rendering the space too dangerous/destructive for satellites and space travel) is examined and a framework for regulating/minimizing that. Mega-constellations (i.e. Starlink) have massively increased the risk. Will mandating shortening de-orbit rules be offset by the increased launches? Can spacecraft be strengthened to resist debris, and in turn create less debris?

In which Kessler revisits the Kessler Syndrome and finding that (in 1991), many regions of low Earth orbit were already unstable due to space debris from old rockets and payloads and fragments from explosions. Future collisions have the potential to generate new fragments from collisions faster than atmosphereic drag could remove them. Being able to reverse this situation is unlikely.

In which healthcare, in crisis particularly in the US and UK, could continue to degrade. With one path towards ever increasing efficiency, data collection, and technical mechanisation of healthcare, with increased involvement of retail and data corporations and lots of pharmaceuticals. Or the path (obviously favoured by the authors) to recognise the crisis as a crisis in care, requiring human responses and interactions. Going past what makes life possible to what makes living meaningful.

In which the information processing speed of the brain and how that impacts human behaviour is examined. Our senses work at a rate of 10^9 bits per second while the overall information throughput is 10 bits per second (limited by time required to commit to short term memory). No real evidence for photographic memories. Brain storage conventionally estimated at 50TB but probably more like 5GB. 10b/sec limit probably evolutionally sufficient for survival. Brain implants (Neuralink) also probably limited to 10b/sec. Eye implants for blind probably better achieved thorough natural language speech narration than video connection to brain. Processing probably limited to serial not parallel. Suggestion that there is an outer brain (dealing with sensory input and motor output) and inner brain with reduced data flow to make decisions and control behaviour.

In which questions are asked about where are sports stadiums being sited in the last 2 decades and do communities benefit? 2/3 of the costs through public finance, almost always in a CBD. Generally low community contestation. Only 5 of 89 stadiums built under a community-governed community benefit agreement (generally lower capacity stadiums). Subsidies appear to continue while little benefit flows back to the community.

In which parking lots are found to have a large negative impact on walkability. Objective scores are 3.5x less than pedestrian/bike path segments. Subjective assessments are not attractive and feel unsafe to walk in. Must walk through a parking lot to reach most buildings. Adding some pedestrian features (enclosure, tree cover, traffic control devices) can make parking lots slightly less bad.

In which gender and weather are considered in their impacts on active travel in Sydney. Male cyclists outnumber female 3-1 (greater imbalance than with walking). More cyclists and pedestrians on sunny days (especially sensitive with cyclists). Most active at afternoon peak hours. However, none of these factors shifted the gender ratios.

In which appropriative signification (co-opting language of protest) is being used as a tactic to maintain fossil fuel dependency. Mixed up with petro-masculinity, white patriarchy, and microfascism. Language such as "black lives matter" reformulated into "oil lives matter", and that fossil fuel usage is doing your patriotic duty, further overlaid with messages of white supremacy and racism and claims of victimization and "woke" agendas. Dystopian tactics but also perhaps indications of defensiveness from a dying industry.

In which themes from billboards around new residential suburbs in outer Melbourne are used to examine the Australian Dream of suburban home ownership. How do residents of these mass produced housing developments create communities (not a priority of planners and developers)? Infrastructure often lacking, reflected in lots of cars and car dependency. Some reflection of culture in outdoor ornamentation. Extensive lawns mostly replaced by tiny fake grass front lawns. Has the home become a focus for anxiety and alienation rather than a refuge from them?

In which the patterns of misinformation and relationships between party politics in 26 Western countries are examined using 32 million Tweets. Findings are that populism is not specifically associated with misinformation. Generally not spread by right-wing parties or left-wing populists, but very associated with radical right-wing populists parties. Used as agenda-setting and control over public attention. Goals of left and right-wing populists are different, grievances against the "elite" vs seeking to overthrow democracy and replace with authoritarian leaders.

In which, the heat wave gap metric (time between two adjacent heat waves) was calculated for 1961-90 and 1991-2020 in New York City. Findings are that the gaps on average decreased by 15-41%. Number of shorter gaps (less than 5 days) increased 33-300% while longer gaps stayed roughly constant. Slight changes in typical atmospheric flow patterns are associated with the shortening gaps.

In which the stability of core political predispositions over a life-span are examined. Study (in 1999) covered the period 1940 to 1977, beginning at about age 30. Racial prejudices (antiblack attitudes) show remarkable persistence over a lifetime and their impacts on partisan alignments. Essentially, both remain stable throughout.

In which the (generally ignored) social and environmental impacts of generative artificial intelligence are discussed. Hardware (GPUs) and operations require huge amounts of minerals, energy, and water, followed by subsequent e-waste. Social impacts include noise, real estate space, electricity prices, and mining impacts. Authors recommend better quantification (transdisciplinary) of the lifecycle impacts and political and regulatory pressure to ensure these disclosures.

In which the reasons behind stagnating (and declining in recent years) life expectancies (over 1970-2014) in the US are examined. Highly associated with policies at a state level, with conservative states showing a reduction in life expectancies. If the liberal state policies had been in place across all states, life expectancies would be 2.8 and 2.1 years longer for woman and men. Policy categories include abortion, campaign finance, civil rights, criminal justice, education, environment, gun control, health/welfare, housing/transport, immigration, labor, taxes, and voting. Would be interesting to see the results from an analysis that also included COVID-19 (very deadly in red states).

In which the Microsoft AI Red Team evaluates the safety and security of 100 GenAI Microsoft products. Findings are that very simple methods generally work well (often better than sophisticated methods) to attack AI systems. AI harms are pervasive but hard to measure. LLMs add an extra level of security risks in addition to making existing ones worse. It will likely never be possible to secure AI systems. None of this seems like great news as everybody rushes to embed GenAI in everything.

In which research about how people change their beliefs about climate change provides a framework to facilitate greater acceptance of reality. Multiple theories try to explain why people adopt beliefs or are resistant to shifting their views. Process of shifting required a few steps. First is distancing from the community that influenced initial beliefs. Second, a desire to seek out information. Finally, the shift happened either gradually or as an epiphany. Interpersonal conversations can be influential in opinion shifts.

In which the impact of AI usage on cognitive skills is assessed. Cognitive offloading uses external tools to assist in reducing cognitive load, allowing reduced memory use and lighter engagement with a problem. Study finds 17-25 year olds higher AI tool usage and cognitive offloading and lower critical thinking scores. Frequent users of AI show dependence on these tools, reduced ability to problem solve, and show concerns over the transparency and bias of AI answers. Also, have some awareness of their dependency and reduced skills. Those with higher education sometimes fact check AI answers.

In which the potential for AI to address the "productivity crisis" is examined by looking at AI adoption in Canadian firms 2020-2021. (Time period doesn't include ChatGPT, introduced 2022).  Findings are that productivity gains from AI adoption are inconclusive (neither strong positive or negative relationship). No significant relationship was found between AI adoption and Total Factor Productivity levels or growth. Firms that did adopt AI were already more productive than those firms who didn't.

In which the impact of wildlife-friendly gardening practices on biodiversity across SW Australia is examined. Structures include bat and bird boxes, bird baths, frog hotels, possum shelters, ponds, and reptile shelters. Water sources (bird baths and ponds) are found to be especially important across a broad range of biodiversity. Many of the structures were used by not only the target species, but others as well. Bat boxes and frog hotels not particularly successful (might be design and placement problem). Reptile shelters used a bit more. Some structures shown to be of benefit to endangered species. Suburban gardens can play a role in biodiversity conservation.

In which the representation of water balances in 19 urban land surface models are tested in the Urban-PLUMBER intercomparion project. Indicators of water balance closure, evapotranspiration, storage, and runoff are used. Most models do not close water balance. Lack of irrigation in most models found to be a problem. For ET and storage, timing better captured than magnitude. Water storage schemes are often inconsistent. However, better water representation didn't necessarily lead to more accurate latent fluxes. Runoff often poorly captured. Overall evaluation is difficult because of limited observation datasets.

In which a framework to evaluate car dependency is developed with seven components. Components range from external to an individual (land use system, transport systems, natural environment) to internal (objective features - socio-economic, disability, mobility means or subjective features - perceived security on public transport). Crossover of components include temporal (car as time-saving, activity time requirements, service opening hours, transport service times) and social environment (living location, subjective norms, social responsibilities). Policy decisions around car dependency should consider the full range of components.

In which the racial prejudices of welfare systems is explained. Findings are that when whites perceive threats to their advantage in the hierarchy, minority resentment increases, driving decreased support for welfare programs (if they perceive benefits to minorities). Welfare backlash follows from perceptions of rising standing of minorities.

In which postdoctoral periods are examined for factors leading to career retention and success (transition from postdoc to faculty position). 41% of postdocs leave academia. Those who, as a postdoc or PhD student, have a hit paper (reflected in citation indexes) more likely to remain in academia. Slight changes in topic (widening research) are also helpful. Moving to another country also associated with broadening experience. New faculty hires more often when PhD is from a higher ranked institution, where postdoc hires more often moving to a higher ranked institution.

In which it is attempted to reverse engineer the Uber surge pricing algorithm. Findings are that the driver supply limitation is probably irrelevant, the main limitation is when compensation Uber offers drivers goes below vehicle operating costs (increased fares from surge pricing sometimes/often? not passed onto the driver and might actually decrease during these times to push drivers out of the available pool). Unregulated nature of Uber's business means Uber's price manipulations are opaque.

Estimated that 90% of existing UK homes will overheat under 2C climate change. Findings of large increases in vulnerability for pre-1900 housing, those with multiple deprivations. Some increases for small floor areas (<50m2) and older persons. Renters less adaptability to adapt. Heating and energy poverty is an issue that might be slightly mitigated by warming.

Members of the Greens party cycled the most (76%) with CVP (center right) at 73%. About 66% of SP (center left), FDP (right wing), and SVP (right wing populist). Unaffiliated at 33%. Most frequent cyclists leaned towards the left (but not exactly). Greens more frequently cycled for transport. Recreational only cyclists more often center and right. Left leaning parties tend to support cycling policy in proportion to their members where right leaning parties' policies are less supportive.

In which warming in relation to the Paris Agreement 1.5C target is discussed. 2024 was the first year of averages above 1.5C, but does that mean we have crossed the 1.5C threshold? Findings are that previous first year exceedences at 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.0C have been the first year of 20 year periods above those levels. Therefore, without immediate strong climate mitigations, 2024 is likely to be the first year of 20 years above 1.5C. Current policy settings closest to SSP 2-4.5 where all models agree with passing the 1.5C threshold. Only SSP 1.9 or 1-2.6 possibly avoid this.

In which the impact of GenAI on critical thinking is quantified. Critical thinking includes knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Findings are that higher confidence in GenAI results are associated with less critical thinking. Reduced effort leads to less engagement with tasks. Authors recommend GenAI should create awareness of lack of critical thinking. I guess this is the system somehow forcing the user to think about what they are doing? I guess also knowledge workers are supposed to accept that they are responsible for whatever GenAI outputs and think critically about how the GenAI is working. Sounds pretty wishful and I assume people will just press the buttons and zone out, because they can.

In which the microclimates of artificial turf (AT) is measured and compared to grass. Findings are soil moisture under AT (AT is porous) decreased slower than grass, possibly greater resistance to vapour transport from compacted soil. Mean daytime air temperatures 0.6C and 0.8C higher than unirrigated/irrigated grass. Nighttime also higher. Vapour pressure differences smaller than instrument accuracy. Mean radiant temperature 1.2C higher. AT higher ground heat flux. Surface temperature 49.9C vs 31.7 and 29.9 average daytime means. Four hours per day, surface temperatures high enough to burn skin (15 seconds of contact), because lower albedos, lower specific heat capacity, lower evapotranspiration.

Positive net migration to sunbelt states (TX, FL, NC, AZ, TN, SC) continues. Some increased migration to WA, OR, CO, ID. Moving from NY, CA, IL. Overall dropping mobility. National mobility rate was 20% in 1948 -> 18% in mid-80s -> 10% in 2019. Local moves 15% in 1980s -> 8% in 2019. Sharpest declines among younger adults. Number of renting household increased while moving renters declined. Reasons behind declines might be ageing population, housing unaffordability, increasing dual income families, more working from home. Implications of Americans becoming less "worldly"?

In which certain "tortured phrases" are catalogued and used to detect paper mill publications. Paper mills churn out articles to boost 'publish or perish' statistics through falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism. "Spinners" disguise plagiarism through paraphrasing, replacements of "convolutional neural network" might end up as "convolutional brain organization".  Searched through recently published papers to catalog lists of these phrases to use as fingerprints. Finding substitutions such as "Electoral integrity" -> "Uprightness of the votes", "Centers for disease control and prevention" -> "Communities for infectious prevention and anticipation", and "Fraud" -> "Trickery in conduct". Scanning PubPeer with these phrases flagged a number of suspicious publications.

In which the shifts in tree ranges in the western US due to climate change are assessed. "Trailing edge/leading edge", the shift ("march") from warmer areas to cooler areas can lead to "contraction" if only one shift occurs without the other. Migration requires seed production and dispersal to new areas and successful growth of those new trees. Disturbances can enable migrations (removing competition by killing trees) but also eliminate seed sources. The 15 dominant species in the western US are undergoing losses due to disturbances and lack of regeneration in hotter areas. Assisted migration might be necessary to facilitate continued migration.

In which the emergence of the concept of stochastic terrorism is discussed. Influential individuals demonise target groups or individuals (i.e. the current demonisation of trans people), inspiring others to take up violence against them. Previously was the "lone wolf" terrorism, what provoked them to violence? A shift in who is the terrorist: the individual doing the violence or the one who inspired the violence (Fox News, Glenn Beck, etc)? How to characterise intent in terrorism? Can violent intent be pinned on the stochastic terrorist (plausible denialability, I had no idea my words would lead to this.)? Question of demonisation, definition is neural, not whether it is right or wrong to do it. So, should also include whether it includes misleadingness or deceitfulness. Dehumanising (already a tactic of authoritarianism) is also part of it. And stochastic terrorism becoming a tool of authoritarian politics. Also, include moral panics (the enemy within). All of the above must be considered in formulating counterterrorism. (But then again, the terrorism might be coming from in the house.)

In which motor vehicle crash costs are quantified. Divided into internal (individuals in crashes) and external costs (costs to victims, insurers, and government). Findings generally correspond with previous research (range of overall costs $0.02 to 0.08 per vehicle km). Their case study shows internal costs at $0.13/veh km and external of $0.079/veh km. Costs caused by drivers higher than those imposed on others. Highways generally safer than surface streets. Crash costs generally too low compared to travel time costs (valued at $18.30/hr), but drivers are not aware of these costs. And yes, policies should include incentives for safe driving.

In which a number of LLMs (ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, Claude, Gemini 1, Gemini 1.5) are given the MoCA test (neurology test for cognitive impairment and dementia, i.e. Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV). The Stroop test (visual attention/information processing) is also administered. All models (except 4o) show some cognitive impairment. All performed poorly on visuospatial/executive function. Naming, attention, language, and abstraction performed well. Further tests on visuospatial, all did poorly on MoCA clock drawing and trail making test. Some LLMs showed avoidant behaviour.

In which current state of the art LLMs (o1, GPT4o, and Claude 3.5) are benchmarked against common software engineering coding problems using the SWE-Lancer benchmarker. If they can successfully solve all the problems in the benchmark, it should be worth the equivalent of 1 million USD in freelance work. Findings are that no LLM would earn more than $400,000. The best performing model (Claude 3.5) has a success rate of about 26%. Improving results often requires extensive "user tool" use (i.e. manual user intervention). The agents perform reasonably well in locating failure points (files or functions), but rarely identify root causes, leading to incorrect or insufficient solutions. So, replacing coders with current LLMs is probably not a good idea. (What's the cost to fix the 70% failure rates?)

In which life expectancies in the Gaza Strip are calculated. Findings are the ongoing war on Gaza has reduced life expectancy by more than 30 years during 10/23 to 9/24 (nearly half of prewar levels). Reported deaths (killed) during this time are around 46,000 (and 10,000 missing). Data from Gaza Health Ministry has uncertainties. But this conservative accounting could be an underestimate. Also, probably doesn't account for starvation, malnutrition, or access to health care (i.e. indirect effects of war).

In which the amount of space used for renewables across the world is compared to space allocated to golf courses. Authors counted 38,000 golf courses across the world (16k in the US), average size of 0.8km2. Significant increase in golf courses since 1985. Renewable requires 0.015km2/MW. So Canada 16x more golf space than renewables, 6x UK, 4x US, 1.25x Germany. Number of golf courses projected to grow. Energy justice, golf courses are exclusive while energy is a public necessity. Most countries could meet 2028 renewables capacity forecast with golf course land (except Germany, S Korea, France). And China also, which can't meet current renewables on their golf courses.

In which the economic returns on US foreign aid are quantified. Hypothesis is aid boosts exports by economic growth of recipient country and the good will from the aid. Examines commercial returns from 39 countries over 22 years. Findings that each dollar of foreign aid gained $8 in exports through bilateral trade. The economic returns are in addition to donor reputation, social responsibility.

In which the under reporting of of high air temperatures across Sydney is studied. Sydney is covered by 5 official BOM weather stations. Air temperature loggers were installed at 274 locations across Sydney. Findings of long-term increases in hot days, especially in 2000-2020. Longer and more intense heatwaves 2010-20 compared to 2000-10. Forecast of nearly doubling hot days in 2060. BOM station coverage insufficient to account for areas exceeding official heat records (number of hot days), some areas max temperatures exceeding by 8C. Other areas, number of extreme days 15x what recorded by BOM. Impacts especially in western Sydney. Highlights need for higher resolution sensor networks.

In which the roots of motonormativity (the over reliance on private automotive transport is unquestioned and considered just the normal way the world should work) are examined. Same biases are shared even by non-drivers. But is this bias shared by countries with cultural norms more aligned with non-motorised mobility (Netherlands)? Findings of pluralistic ignorance (majority believe social consensus is different to theirs and they are a minority), I am more supportive of non-car travel than others. Resulting in road policy change difficulties because perceptions that majority opinions are unpopular.

In which how structures of power influence travel behaviour and mobility emissions (NOx) are examined in Barcelona. Findings that middle aged men (European origin or not) contribute to pollution emissions far greater than their population proportion. Younger and older adults, especially women (and especially foreign born), contribute far less. i.e. age and gender best predictor of individual pollution levels. Middle aged men generally unconstrained access to car ownership. Raises issues of environmental justice and equity.
