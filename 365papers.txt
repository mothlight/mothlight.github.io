I did 365papers a few years ago. Lots of work but ultimately quite rewarding reading and writing about 365 papers over a year. So, I'll try again this year starting with this very recent paper. 
1/ #365papers 
In which a new module for the PUCM urban canopy model is developed, PUCM-mist, to model the impacts of misters. Modelling is performed for Phoenix and Houston (dry and humid climates), finding a flow rate of 0.1L/min can induce reductions in maximum canyon air temperature of 17.5C. Cooling is also seen in Houston, but about half that amount. Optimal cooling under intermediate wind speeds. Rapid cooling can be induced through the combination of misting and pavement sprinkling. Trying to wrap my head around the 17.5C, which is huge, but using lots of water and saturating the air, and altering both the potential maximum temperature and the time of day the maximum is reached.

In which the author (who is the founder of Sci-Hub) discusses different types of open access for scientific publications (and color codes), ranging from Sci-Hub (red), open access - PloS, MDPI, Frontiers (yellow/gold), preprints - arXiv (green), academic social networks - ResearchGate (blue). New categories beyond the green and gold ones established after the Budapest Open Access Initiative.

In which proposed policies (mass deportations, tariffs, reduced independence of the Federal Reserve) of a second Trump presidency are evaluated for their potential impacts on the US and global economy. Combined scenarios of high impact (60% tariffs with trading partner retaliations, 8 million deportations, no Reserve independence) could cause a 10% reduction in GDP and 7% inflation while lower impact (60% tariffs without retaliations, 1 million deportations, Reserve independence erosion) will still account for 3% reduction in GDP and 4% inflation.

In which the impacts of tree planting projects for biomass storage at high northern latitudes are examined. The disturbances caused by albedo changes and the disruption of soil carbon storage will cause net warming and negative effects on Arctic biota and livelihoods. Tree planting can be great but the Arctic probably isn't the right place for it.

4/ #365papers 

In which, using wet-bulb temperature (accounting for humid heat) data across Mexico, high heat kills disproportionately more young people (especially under 5) than elderly (who more more vulnerable to cold). Children have higher body surface area, less developed immune systems, and less independence to express their discomfort. And young adults have higher exposure to high heat situations and less resources to adapt. Further, climate change is expected to drive increased disproportionate impacts.

5/ #365papers 

In which many questions and assumptions about urban scaling theory are addressed. Urban scaling started as identifying nonlinear relationships of urban growth relative to population. Contrasts are made between scaling and Zipf's and Gravity laws. How different definitions of cities effect them. Do they apply to past settlements? Interactions between cities. And the place of urban scaling in general urban science.

6/ #365papers 

In which the author examines (in 1955) how earthworms react to different water conditions (dry vs full immersion). Sort of trying to find why worms are found on pavement after rain. They show some resistance to desiccation.  
Some worms are found to be able to survive underwater for days or even weeks. Given a choice, some species seek air-filled soil while some go for water-filled soil.

7/ #365papers 

In which, in more recent earthworm research, some species show poor tolerance to water immersion and generally use more oxygen at night. Other species can survive longer underwater and have lower oxygen consumption and without a diurnal rhythm. So, why worms emerge from rain soaked soil at night might depend on which species and different oxygen needs.

8/ #365papers 

In which the rates of divorce (termination of a pair bond) of the Seychelles warbler are examined as influenced by weather. Findings are that increased divorces are preceded by years of low and high rainfall. It remains unclear whether this is adaptive, maladaptive, or neutral. Or can these behaviour changes help adapt to a changing climate?

9/ #365papers 

In which the increase in emissions to add AI generated answers (GPT-3) to Google search results is quantified. In 2009, Google search used about 0.0003 kWh per search (0.2g of CO2). Increased efficiency probably means current searches use 0.000004 kWh. Adding AI probably brings this up to 0.002 kWh, or about 100 times more. Additionally, while training AI is resource intensive, the subsequent usage of ChatGPT dominates emissions.

10/ #365papers 

In which the openness of OpenAI (and AI in general) is examined. Findings are that most modern AI is dependent on and controlled by a few large corporations. Openness mostly fails in the categories of transparency, reusability, and extensibility. Underlying hidden problem of colonialism - labor exploitation and cultural data sovereignty. Necessary computational resources close general access. AI might have a similar story to corporate dominance moves in open-source software, but some differences exist.

In which the potential for the Kessler Syndrome (runaway debris growth in Earth's orbit rendering the space too dangerous/destructive for satellites and space travel) is examined and a framework for regulating/minimizing that. Mega-constellations (i.e. Starlink) have massively increased the risk. Will mandating shortening de-orbit rules be offset by the increased launches? Can spacecraft be strengthened to resist debris, and in turn create less debris?

12/ #365papers 

In which Kessler revisits the Kessler Syndrome and finding that (in 1991), many regions of low Earth orbit were already unstable due to space debris from old rockets and payloads and fragments from explosions. Future collisions have the potential to generate new fragments from collisions faster than atmosphereic drag could remove them. Being able to reverse this situation is unlikely.

In which healthcare, in crisis particularly in the US and UK, could continue to degrade. With one path towards ever increasing efficiency, data collection, and technical mechanisation of healthcare, with increased involvement of retail and data corporations and lots of pharmaceuticals. Or the path (obviously favoured by the authors) to recognise the crisis as a crisis in care, requiring human responses and interactions. Going past what makes life possible to what makes living meaningful.

In which the information processing speed of the brain and how that impacts human behaviour is examined. Our senses work at a rate of 10^9 bits per second while the overall information throughput is 10 bits per second (limited by time required to commit to short term memory). No real evidence for photographic memories. Brain storage conventionally estimated at 50TB but probably more like 5GB. 10b/sec limit probably evolutionally sufficient for survival. Brain implants (Neuralink) also probably limited to 10b/sec. Eye implants for blind probably better achieved thorough natural language speech narration than video connection to brain. Processing probably limited to serial not parallel. Suggestion that there is an outer brain (dealing with sensory input and motor output) and inner brain with reduced data flow to make decisions and control behaviour.

In which questions are asked about where are sports stadiums being sited in the last 2 decades and do communities benefit? 2/3 of the costs through public finance, almost always in a CBD. Generally low community contestation. Only 5 of 89 stadiums built under a community-governed community benefit agreement (generally lower capacity stadiums). Subsidies appear to continue while little benefit flows back to the community.

In which parking lots are found to have a large negative impact on walkability. Objective scores are 3.5x less than pedestrian/bike path segments. Subjective assessments are not attractive and feel unsafe to walk in. Must walk through a parking lot to reach most buildings. Adding some pedestrian features (enclosure, tree cover, traffic control devices) can make parking lots slightly less bad.

In which gender and weather are considered in their impacts on active travel in Sydney. Male cyclists outnumber female 3-1 (greater imbalance than with walking). More cyclists and pedestrians on sunny days (especially sensitive with cyclists). Most active at afternoon peak hours. However, none of these factors shifted the gender ratios.

In which appropriative signification (co-opting language of protest) is being used as a tactic to maintain fossil fuel dependency. Mixed up with petro-masculinity, white patriarchy, and microfascism. Language such as "black lives matter" reformulated into "oil lives matter", and that fossil fuel usage is doing your patriotic duty, further overlaid with messages of white supremacy and racism and claims of victimization and "woke" agendas. Dystopian tactics but also perhaps indications of defensiveness from a dying industry.

In which themes from billboards around new residential suburbs in outer Melbourne are used to examine the Australian Dream of suburban home ownership. How do residents of these mass produced housing developments create communities (not a priority of planners and developers)? Infrastructure often lacking, reflected in lots of cars and car dependency. Some reflection of culture in outdoor ornamentation. Extensive lawns mostly replaced by tiny fake grass front lawns. Has the home become a focus for anxiety and alienation rather than a refuge from them?

In which thoughts on the new emerging field of spatial data science are discussed. Perhaps an extension of geoinformatics, with a huge increase in data sources and new methods to analyse using machine learning. Work often by people who do not have traditional geospatial backgrounds. So, how should teaching in this new field be done and how should course work be designed?

In which the patterns of misinformation and relationships between party politics in 26 Western countries are examined using 32 million Tweets. Findings are that populism is not specifically associated with misinformation. Generally not spread by right-wing parties or left-wing populists, but very associated with radical right-wing populists parties. Used as agenda-setting and control over public attention. Goals of left and right-wing populists are different, grievances against the "elite" vs seeking to overthrow democracy and replace with authoritarian leaders.

In which, the heat wave gap metric (time between two adjacent heat waves) was calculated for 1961-90 and 1991-2020 in New York City. Findings are that the gaps on average decreased by 15-41%. Number of shorter gaps (less than 5 days) increased 33-300% while longer gaps stayed roughly constant. Slight changes in typical atmosphereic flow patterns are associated with the shortening gaps.

In which the stability of core political predispositions over a life-span are examined. Study (in 1999) covered the period 1940 to 1977, beginning at about age 30. Racial prejudices (antiblack attitudes) show remarkable persistence over a lifetime and their impacts on partisan alignments. Essentially, both remain stable throughout.

In which the (generally ignored) social and environmental impacts of generative artificial intelligence are discussed. Hardware (GPUs) and operations require huge amounts of minerals, energy, and water, followed by subsequent e-waste. Social impacts include noise, real estate space, electricity prices, and mining impacts. Authors recommend better quantification (transdisciplinary) of the lifecycle impacts and political and regulatory pressure to ensure these disclosures.

In which the reasons behind stagnating (and declining in recent years) life expectancies (over 1970-2014) in the US are examined. Highly associated with policies at a state level, with conservative states showing a reduction in life expectancies. If the liberal state policies had been in place across all states, life expectancies would be 2.8 and 2.1 years longer for woman and men. Policy categories include abortion, campaign finance, civil rights, criminal justice, education, environment, gun control, health/welfare, housing/transport, immigration, labor, taxes, and voting. Would be interesting to see the results from an analysis that also included COVID-19 (very deadly in red states).

In which the 'The Air Pollution Model' (TAPM) is used to test the heat mitigation effectiveness of green and cool roofs (high albedo) in Melbourne as measured by apparent temperature. Mix of 25/75% green/cool roof best or reduce max air temperature. 50/50 green/cool best reductions of minimum and average air temperature. 50/50 also best for apparent temperature reductions.
