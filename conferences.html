<p><b>Australia - Asia Dialogue for Urban Innovation: Smart Cities</b>
<p>The Seminar Series of “Australia-Asia Dialogue for Urban Innovation” focuses on innovative urban approaches to critical global challenges that require collective actions for current and future generations. This series will contribute to establishing the research network and sharing knowledge with leading academic institutions in Australia and Asia. These quarterly events will seek evidence-based policy practices for urban innovation in Australia and Asia.
<p>As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, interconnected, and dependent on technology, smart cities provide a promising picture of the city of the future. The use of sophisticated and integrated information and communication technology in various urban activities, from transportation, energy, buildings, and manufacturing, to government, not only encourages the more effective improvement of the quality of public services but also encourages sustainable use of resources and increases city liveability. It also provides greater opportunities for people to connect with others and access economic opportunities. But the fundamental question is: is this concept just a myth, or can it be implemented in reality?
<p>The seminar will begin with a presentation from Dr. Xiao Ma, who explores the politics of transnational transport infrastructure and service provision. Then, Prof. Tan Yigitcanlar will explore smart city blueprints. Prof. Sugie Lee will give the following presentation, which elaborates on the limitations and future directions of applications of artificial intelligence in city and regional planning. The final presentation will be delivered by Dr. Kerry Nice, which looks at the use of computer vision and neural networks in assessing high-performance city design, especially concerning visions of healthy urban design. This event will have Q&As, which will be moderated by A/Prof. Masa Noguchi.
<p>The seminar will be held in the Japanese Room, Glyn Davis Building, Monday, May 8, 2 p.m.–3:30 p.m., followed by afternoon tea.<p>L﻿ist of Presentations:<p>D﻿r Xiao Ma (Postdoctoral Research Fellow, The University of Melbourne): The Politics of Transnational Transport Infrastructure and Service Provision<p>Prof. Tan Yigitcanlar (School of Architecture and Built Environment, Queensland University of Technology): Smart City Blueprint<p>Prof. Sugie Lee (Department of Urban Planning & Engineering Hanyang University, South Korea): Applications of Artificial Intelligence in City and Regional Planning: Limitations and Future Directions<p>Dr. Kerry Nice (Research Fellow, Transport, Health, and Urban Design (THUD) Research Lab, The University of Melbourne): Visions of Healthy Urban Design: The Use of Computer Vision and Neural Networks in Assessing High-Performance City Design</b><hr></div>

<p><b>Understanding within-city interaction between surface and air temperatures</b>
<p>Marzie Naserikia, Melissa A. Hart, Negin Nazarian, Benjamin Bechtel, and <b>Kerry A. Nice</b> 

<p>Urban heat is a local scale warming effect associated with urban areas where most of the world's population live. Due to the scarcity of air temperature (Ta) data, urban heat studies have been mostly focused on Land Surface Temperature (LST) extracted from satellite imagery and a quantitative understanding of how LST interacts with Ta within a city is still lacking. Using crowdsourced weather station data in Sydney, Australia, combined with high resolution satellite images and urban datasets (such as Local Climate Zone (LCZ) and building-level urban data), we explore the interaction between Ta and LST, and their intra-urban variabilities during different seasons. We found that LST and Ta have different characteristics and their dependency varies by season and LCZ. When exploring the relationship between Ta, LST, and variables describing the urban structure, such as building fraction, the correlation between LST and urban structure was stronger and more seasonal dependent than the Ta-urban form relationship. Moreover, stronger correlations between LST and Ta were observed in the less built-up areas within the city. We also found that the determinants of LST variability are different from the contributing factors of Ta. These findings provide new insights for quantitatively investigating surface and canopy urban heat and their relationship with land cover, providing fit-for-purpose information to mitigate the adverse effects of urban overheating at local and global scales.

<p>Could we conjure up an accurate vision of a time or a place if we had never been there? Could we then envisage such a place through another’s eyes? What if we could delve into entire world’s collective understanding of a place or perspective and extract an example of that representation? Would such a vision be robust, believable, or an any way meaningful? What effect might extracting such a scene have on our own understanding of empathy, creativity, imagination, possibility, or design practice? 

<p>To date, a limiting feature of artificial intelligence (AI) in applications ranging from those used in financial markets to health, object detection, and design has been their reliance on vast historical datasets from which they build perceptions and projections of the world before to relaying this information back to humans. This reliance has so far left scant room for apparent understanding, interpretation, or imagination of the sort truly recognised as ‘intelligence’ by humans. Suchlimitations, however, are perhaps drawing to a close with the advent of text-to-image generators(1). Text-to-image generators are opening the door for AI applications to reach human levels of conceptual creativity resembling considered integration, interpretation, and genuine imagination - with the capacity to even build memories of their own.

<p>Contemporary text-to image generators are now enabling designers to combine and re-imagine features, objects, locations, times, scenes, and styles that can generate unique visions spanning anywhere from reality to impressionism to bizarre fiction. In doing so, they can lead us on an exploration of an alternate and at times fascinating potential world of how others might have seen or interpreted a place like Parkville. 

<p>In this presentation we demonstrate a re-imagining of Parkville and surrounds through capturing the collective hive-mind of the world-wide web using modern text-to image generators. We demonstrate an interpretation of Parkville under conditions where the features we desire and the lens we peer through are selected, combined, and balanced. We ask for consideration of what the model really understands, what the images convey, and leave open a discussion of the aesthetics, ethics, and meaning of artificially generated design to the audience. We show how artificial design resemblingimagination, will be a feature of our future and perhaps eventually, even our history.

style="display:none;"><b><p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries implemented public health ordinances that resulted in restricted mobility and a resultant change in air quality. This has provided an opportunity to quantify the extent to which carbon-based transport and industrial activity affect air quality. In this study, confounding factors were disentangled for a direct comparison of pandemic-related reductions in absolute pollutions levels, globally. The non-linear relationships between atmospheric processes and daily ground-level NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and O3 measurements were captured in city- and pollutant-specific XGBoost models for over 700 cities, adjusting for weather, seasonality and trends. City-level modelling allowed adaptation to the distinct topography, urban morphology, climate and atmospheric conditions for each city, individually, as the weather variables that were most predictive varied across cities. Pollution forecasts for 2020 in absence of a pandemic were generated based on weather and formed an ensemble for country-level pollution reductions. Findings were robust to modelling assumptions and consistent with various published case studies. NO2 reduced most in China, Europe and India, following severe government restrictions as part of the initial lockdowns. Reductions were highly correlated with changes in mobility levels, especially trips to transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation venues. Further, NO2 did not fully revert to pre-pandemic levels in 2020. Ambient PM2.5 pollution, which has severe adverse health consequences, reduced most in China and India. Increased O3 levels during initial lockdowns have been documented widely. However, our analyses found a subsequent reduction in O3 for many countries below what was expected based on meteorological conditions during summer months (e.g., China, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Turkey). The effects in periods with high O3 levels are especially important for the development of effective mitigation strategies to improve health outcomes.</b><hr></div>

style="display:none;"><b><p>In urban areas, high quality land cover datasets are required to take full advantage of improvements offered by sub-kilometre weather and climate simulations. At the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, we are expanding our modelling capabilities to allow ~100 m simulations over major Australian cities and so require better urban maps. We describe the Bureau’s work replacing traditional single-class urban maps (e.g. IGBP or CCI) with newer, higher-quality datasets available at national and global scales (e.g., Geoscape, WorldCover, WSF3D, CCIv2 and global LCZs). We assess the strengths and weaknesses of the different datasets in terms of accuracy, fidelity, availability and impact on forecasting skill. We describe the variables available in each dataset (land cover, building and vegetation morphology, etc.), and how this impacts the configuration of different urban models. Our early and preliminary results show the highest resolution datasets with the most morphology information (e.g., Geoscape) provide the greatest benefit to forecasting skill. While Geoscape is a restricted dataset in its native resolution (~1 m), we provide a new open Geoscape-derived dataset at 300 m resolutions over the greater Sydney region, including all input variables typically required by urban weather and climate models. We also describe our methods to convert other openly and globally available high-resolution datasets to appropriate model input formats.</b><hr></div>

This project assesses the performance of land surface models used in meteorological simulations of urban areas. Phase 1 included 24 models of varying complexity, from simple slab models through to multi-layer urban canopy models.<p>54 model output variables are requested, including primary surface energy fluxes, anthropogenic heat and moisture fluxes, soil variables, albedo, canopy and building air temperatures. This rich dataset is used to both compare model outputs with observations and to understand factors contributing to model performance.<p>The project involved a number of other innovations including:<p>An online portal (modelevaluation.org) is used to distribute site data and accept submissions.<p>Upon submission to the portal participants are provided with variable near-instant compliance checks and analyses allowing participants to make corrections if required.<p>A ten-year ERA5-derived spin up which overcomes the typically short period of urban flux tower observations and allows the entire observed period to be used in analyses.<p>Testing models alongside simple empirical benchmarks (e.g. out-of-sample linear regression of turbulent fluxes on shortwave radiation) to assess if input information is used effectively.<p>We also discuss the initial stages of Phase 2 which involves testing models at many urban sites. From the known global urban flux tower observations, following assessment, 25 are selected to capture a range of urban characteristics and climates. Surface characteristics are gathered, observations quality controlled and prepended with ten years of bias corrected ERA5 meteorological data for spinup. This new standardised urban flux tower dataset will become a valuable tool in future urban modelling projects.</b><hr></div>
