Hello,
Your research proposal looks interesting and is in line with the research I do and that we perform in our research lab. 

You will have to go through the University of Melbourne admissions process first, which is very competitive. I think you need a weighted average of at least 75% among many other requirements (and for all practical purposes it has to be well over 80% to be in the running for a scholarship). More details about PhD programs in ABP and the Melbourne School of Design:

For specific information about what is required in an application, including the research proposal requirements, please see this page:

A strong well-written proposal is an important part of your submission. Your proposal should also try to align with the research goals of the Faculty:

I'm happy to be named on your application as a potential supervisor.

Thanks,
Kerry.

I do have some funding from South East Water in conjunction with their Aquarevo housing estate:
https://villawoodproperties.com.au/community/aquarevo/about/
that I'm trying to convert into a PhD project. That project would be measuring the cooling impact of irrigation at a neighborhood scale, placing instruments around the neighborhood and utilizing the detailed water usage data available from SE Water. That student still needs to get through the university admissions process but with the funding there are some other possibilities available. Possibly through the Faculty of Science and the school of urban horticulture.

I would suggest contacting the admissions people and talking through your options there. I'm happy to be named on your application as a potential supervisor.

I'm not actually sure if you were applying for a Masters or a PhD program. I'm less sure of the process for Masters, but that information should be on the study.unimelb website. I'm not sure if the Masters program requires a research proposal or not. 

But either way, I would make sure that your proposal aligns with the research goals of the Faculty:
https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/research/directions
Also, I think your proposal could be a little more specific, are you proposing a new methodology or will it be a method be applied to some research question? Certainly the expectations for the PhD proposal is that you will have formulated a research question and have detailed your intended methodology to carry out the research. In the application for the PhD, the quality of the proposal is highly weighted.

Thanks,
Kerry.
