Hello,
Your research proposal looks interesting and is in line with the research I do (https://mothlight.github.io/) and that we perform in our research lab (https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/thus/)

There are two main steps, admissions to the PhD program at the University of Melbourne, and then securing a scholarship. Both of these are very competitive. More details about PhD programs in ABP and the Melbourne School of Design: 
https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/doctor-of-philosophy-architecture-building-and-planning/
There is also the possibility of bringing a scholarship with you, such as the China Scholarship Council scholarships.

For specific information about what is required in an application, including the research proposal requirements, please see this page:

A strong well-written proposal is an important part of your submission. You will want to develop a research program that is innovative and substantial and worthy of three years of research. But you also don't want to promise too much so there is no way you could actually finish it all. A goal of writing three papers during a PhD is a pretty reasonable goal. This is good guide to the general amount of content that should go into that sort of thesis (thesis by publication) and be reflected in your proposal: https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/graduate-research-services/incorporating-publications-in-your-thesis

This is also a sample template for your proposal:

Your proposal should also try to align with the research goals of the Faculty:

I'm happy to be named on your application as a potential supervisor. If you want to discuss your project proposal, I'm also happy to provide some feedback on that as well.

I'm also encouraging some candidates (climate related ones) to also apply to the Faculty of Science (and list me as co-supervisor). I'm happy to co-supervise across faculties along with colleagues Stephen Livesley or Mohammad Rahman. My faculty only has about 10-15 scholarships to award every year, so it is very difficult.

The process for Science I believe is also a bit different. My faculty (ABP) puts great emphasis on the proposal, Science is more collaborative in developing the project and puts greater weight on the applicant's research and academic records.

Thanks,
Kerry.

I do have some funding from South East Water in conjunction with their Aquarevo housing estate:
https://villawoodproperties.com.au/community/aquarevo/about/
that I'm trying to convert into a PhD project. That project would be measuring the cooling impact of irrigation at a neighborhood scale, placing instruments around the neighborhood and utilizing the detailed water usage data available from SE Water. That student still needs to get through the university admissions process but with the funding there are some other possibilities available. Possibly through the Faculty of Science and the school of urban horticulture.






Hello,
Your research proposal looks interesting and in line with the research I do and that we perform in our research lab.

However, you will have to go through the University of Melbourne admissions process first, which is very competitive. I think you need a weighted average of at least 75% among many other requirements (and for all practical purposes it has to be well over 80% to be in the running for a scholarship).

I would suggest contacting the admissions people and talking through your options there. I'm happy to be named on your application as a potential supervisor.

I'm happy to be named on your application as a potential supervisor.

I'm not actually sure if you were applying for a Masters or a PhD program. I'm less sure of the process for Masters, but that information should be on the study.unimelb website. I'm not sure if the Masters program requires a research proposal or not. 

But either way, I would make sure that your proposal aligns with the research goals of the Faculty:
https://msd.unimelb.edu.au/research/directions
Also, I think your proposal could be a little more specific, are you proposing a new methodology or will it be a method be applied to some research question? Certainly the expectations for the PhD proposal is that you will have formulated a research question and have detailed your intended methodology to carry out the research. In the application for the PhD, the quality of the proposal is highly weighted.

Thanks,
Kerry.
