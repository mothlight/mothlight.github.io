<p>Scripts to cut sections out of mp3 files.

<p>Locate the locations of where to start and stop the edits. I recommend using <a href="mp">mplayer</a> from the command line, with a modified <a href="mplayer_input.conf">mplayer_input.conf</a> to change RIGHT seek +5 (5 second jumps).

<p>Then scripts:
<br>cut out from the beginning of a file to 150 (in seconds) from an mp3
<br>usage: <a href="cb.sh">cb.sh</a> filename.mp3 150 

<p>
<br>cut out from 122 to 150 (in seconds) from an mp3
<br>usage: <a href="cm.sh">cm.sh</a> filename.mp3 122 150

<p>
<br>cut out 150 (in seconds) to the end of the file from an mp3
<br>usage: <a href="cm2.sh">cm2.sh</a> filename.mp3 150
